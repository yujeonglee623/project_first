For starters, I have combination skin, thin, prone to dehydration and sensitive. Also, I HATE the feeling of creams on my face, so I always look for light finishes.

I love the Purito Deep Sea Pure Water cream, but the've changed the packaging and, I guess, the formula too. I don't know about the new one. The old one feels light, soft, almost fake, like it's not gonna hydrate. But it does. You just need a bit, like a pea or two for the whole face and it gets absorbed like a charm. And the hydration lasts. It has niacinamide and panthenol and its soothing, so it calms my skins redness. 10/10. Gonna pray they haven't changed the formula.  
The Centella Unscented Recovery cream is also a favourite of mine, mostly during winter, when the Deep Sea one is not enough (in summer the Centella one is too heavy as I live in a VERY humid place). It's a must for sensitive skins or damaged skin barriers. During summer, if my skin gets burned, I use this and the burn heals super fast. Love it. But they've changed the packaging too T\_T  
The Dermide Relief cream is a bit too thick for my liking as a daily moisturizer, but a great help when a specific spot on my face is specially dry or sensitive or when I wanna make a cream/serum more heavy (for ex, if the climate changes for a few days and it gets very dry).   
I also used Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I liked it very much. You can modulate how heavy or light it feels because you can apply more than one layer and it still gets absorbed (unlike Purito's Centella or Dermide Relief, or other creams I've tried, that you put more on your face and just.....sit there, pilling on top of each other). Purito's Deep Sea (old version) is like this too. It's gonna be my salvation if the Deep Sea has changed :\_)  
I also have Purito's Oat In Calming cream but, AGAIN, they've changed the formula. But I've heard great things about the gel version. I've heard it has the best of the cream and it's lighter, so........... Imma buy it soon xD

The Deep Sea would be my top recommendation. With it's formula, it helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skintone, inflamation and hydration. It should still be a great hydrating cream. If not, the Klairs is great, but only for hydration.",1,2025-11-02T09:53:31,POSITIVE,0.709

Felt the obvious prickly sensation on the first time, thereafter I don't feel them that much because I got used to it  I guess? Idk. Everyone on here seems to be saying how uncomfortable their 1st experiences on VT Reedle 100 with some saying it hurt so much that they didn't continue.

So in my book, VT Cosmetics is the frontrunner of this spicules thing and they are sort of the benchmark to compare all other comapnies' spicules products. Since my first experience was with Isntree, and it was pretty mild, I thought the VT 100 would be a step up for me -- at the point I was thinking maybe the Isntree is only comparable to VT 50 perhaps in terms of sensation.

I just tried my first VT 100 a couple of days ago and I thought THAT was even milder than the Isntree? I hardly felt anything at all. So that was a surprise for me. I also have the 300 sample so I'll try that maybe in several days' time see how it feels.

In terms of effects and benefits on my skin, I can't really tell. My most problematic issue is my melasma. I'm hoping by using spicules, it would help anti tyrosinase inhibitors work much better, but melasma is a tricky thing if it's hormonal as even if the epidermal and dermal layers are being treated, the problem will still persist if systemically the hormones are doing the devil's work non-stop lol",1,2025-10-31T15:29:25,NEGATIVE,0.997

Mists sprayed over the whole thing when you’re done can help even more. The key is layering the humectants first until your skin looks dewy. 

That’s a cosmetic approach to the glass-skin look. But a more holistic and natural approach is to get your skin barrier in tip-top shape. When your barrier is in good shape, your skin will have a natural bounce and elasticity, which will make it look soft and dewy.

For both approaches, it is helpful to add ferments to the list of humectants. Ferments make your skin glow if you layer them. Missha 5x revolution, benton fermentation essence, and mixsoon galactomyces are all glow-makers. The glow will heighten the glass-skin effect, and ferments are generally good for skin conditioning in general.

A lot of people jump into K-beauty essences or toners, but what actually helps long term is replenishing the lipid balance. Look for oils or serums that combine squalane, moringa, borage, or marula — these mimic the skin’s natural sebum and deeply hydrate without heaviness.

I formulate small-batch skincare myself, and the biggest mistake I see is skipping nourishment for the barrier. When you give the skin the right fatty acids and antioxidants, it naturally starts to look like “glass skin” because it’s balanced — not because it’s coated in layers.

A lot of korean products are *hydrating* aka glycerine, hyalauronic acid. Watery serums, plumping stuff etc might not be the best place to start because of your skin barrier is super damaged they can sting and cause more irritation. You want moisturizing, oily but noncomedogenic stuff. I don’t have any recs at the moment because i use la roche posay/ plain jojoba oil for these kinds of things but im curious if other people have balm/ thick cream recs",1,2025-10-12T16:34:48,NEGATIVE,0.994

I've recently started using the Dear Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I really like it! It even leaves me a bit oily which I welcome. Their serum in the same product range has been a mainstay for many years for me, it's really good

I'm still testing it out, but the Etude House Soonjung 2x Intensive Barrier Cream is also looking pretty promising. Will have to give it a couple more weeks before I make up my mind though

For cleansers I've liked the Round Lab Birch Juice cleansing gel (the full name escapes me, but it is \*not\* the dokdo one). Relly gentle, not stripping while still leaving my skin feeling clean

Personally I enjoy toners, and I've really loved the iUnik Rose Galactomyces Toner as well as the SIORIS Time Is Running Out mist. The latter is great if I'm feeling super dry 

Also want to add a couple sunscreens I've liked! The Canmake Mermaid UV Gel in ""clear"" is really nice, but it can kind of ""sit on top"" of my skin if I'm extra flaky that day. Another I'm trying right now if the Skin1004 Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum. Looking promising so far, and hasn't accentuated my dry flakes in the same way that the Canmake one can sometimes.",1,2025-10-12T20:16:19,POSITIVE,0.997
