UgwZxsyh8ZQCUO1CpPh4AaABAg,UyBMKPlEw0U,@Krupa777Krupa77,"Hi, Thank you for sharing this video. I have seen your video and acknowledge it. Would also request you to understand  you ever notice that when you exercise ie rotate right hand 12 times and left hand 8 times then does the one rotating higher times increases its length or has any farak?Or when you visit a beauty parlour you massage one chin 10 times and another 8 times, does it make the difference? Does one side is lower then other? its kept proportionate by परमात्मा.Surrender to परमात्मा and not to maintenance of the body. Invest your time in chanting. Understand “मौनातले बोलणे”means when you message, the message speaks what have in your mind.
Reflect on the structure of the heart within the rib’s cage; if reversed, it depicts a lotus flower, delicately settled between the ribs without any external support. Even rib’s cage is अव्यक्त.Similarly, understand the placement of the lungs, meticulously positioned to retain the entire respiratory system.
Each individual has a pair of eyes, a pair of ears, singular nose and similarly other body parts. So Uniformity resides in this aspect across all individuals without any exception. As mentioned in Srimad Bhagwat Geeta 9th Adhya,4th Shlok
मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना |
मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थित
By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
There is no Dharm,जात in creation of human beings. Just like furniture at our home is made from wood, similarly furniture at other’s home is also made from wood. But the looks, shapes of every chair, table is different. Here Wood is तत्त्व.We all come in diverse shapes and forms, much like the variety you see in furniture, but being made from the same basic materials. So You are God-made.
For instance Just as when you visit a shop and ask for your necessities like groceries or vegetables. In similar manner what  you ask in ब्रह्म you receive it. When you offer prayers to the Devi, she with out fail protects you. 
Chanting any devotional Stotras like Srilalita Panchratnam,SriLalita Sahastranam,Sri Mahishasur mardini,Sri Durga Kavach,Sri Durga Chalisa can have profound effects on our skin and overall well-being. You can chant and then immediately massage your  face, you will see a blissful face-glow.
I am writing without any selfish motives. Requesting you to give a thought.
