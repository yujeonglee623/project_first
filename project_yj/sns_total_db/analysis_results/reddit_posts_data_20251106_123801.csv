I read a lot about toners, especially tir tir and anua. do i need a more watery toner like jumiso or is that just for dehydration (im also dry), i ordered the haru haru essence but in hearing a lot of people say u still need a more watery toner under it.

1onzbs9,kbeauty,Has anyone gone to Korea for skincare? I’d love to hear your story.,"**Hi everyone!**

I’ve been going down a huge rabbit hole lately on skincare and medical tourism in Korea. The more I read, the more I realize how hard it is to figure out who to trust, what’s actually safe, and how to plan everything when you don’t speak the language.

I went through something similar myself recently as a male trying to compare clinics, translate treatment names, and piece together Reddit reviews to make sense of prices. It honestly took me weeks.

I’m now exploring an idea to make that process simpler, kind of like a concierge or guide that helps people from the U.S. plan their skincare or aesthetic treatments in Korea, but I’m still very early and mostly just trying to learn from real experiences.

If you’ve ever looked into or done skincare or plastic surgery in Korea, I’d love to chat for 15–20 minutes about how you researched, what was confusing, or what you wish existed.

I'm also willing to offer to help you personally research clinics, pricing, and logistics for free as part of my learning process.

If that sounds okay, just comment or DM me. 🙏

Thanks in advance! Even a few thoughts or horror stories would be super helpful for me to understand where people get stuck.

(Mods, totally fine to remove if not allowed. Just trying to do some firsthand learning.)",daviceinmyhand,2,0.75,4,1762234297.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kbeauty/comments/1onzbs9/has_anyone_gone_to_korea_for_skincare_id_love_to/,https://reddit.com/r/kbeauty/comments/1onzbs9/has_anyone_gone_to_korea_for_skincare_id_love_to/

1omkc3j,kbeauty,Blush & Lip Shade Recommendations? Suited w/ one another +  my skin tone!,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have light medium, warm leaning olive skin, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

￼​**TL;DR** - often blushes look ashy on me, or make my skin appear more olive colored than it is. The lip products I’ve tried aren’t nude/usually not “natural” enough for me, plus I haven’t found a blush and lip shade that match one another. I think it’s bc I look for more warm nude rosy browns for lip but a softer, lighter peach/pink for blush (since that’s my natural blush shade). I sometimes peaches and pinks don’t look good on me at all though, so pls recommend any kinds of **colors/shades most suitable for a natural look!**

I believe I have light medium, warm leaning olive skin. 
——————————————-
Here’s my experience with the blush shades I have:

1.	⁠Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2.	⁠Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3.	⁠Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4.	⁠Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too ashy, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5.	⁠Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

Some lip shades I have:

•	⁠Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1.	⁠Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2.	⁠Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3.	⁠Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4.	⁠Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5.	⁠Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.
———————————————
Anyway, my ideal lip color is one that’s as close to my natural lip color as possible and lines up the best with my skin tone. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink).

The main struggle I’m having is finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too!

I’m hunting for a new moisturizer and can’t decide on one because I never found one for day time that I liked 😭😭😭

I do not have particular skin concerns, I just want something hydrating and that may help reducing pores and maybe just unifying my complexion.

- Skin1004 Centella moisturizer: Didn’t do much for me tbh… It was nice in summer but as the days got colder it feels like my skin is still dry after.
- Purito B5 Panthenol Re-barrier Cream: I used it at night, it was wonderful!! But many people complain about the new formula 😭
- Axis-Y Heartleaf My Type calming cream: it was alright but same, not much results. 

My evening cream is thick (numbuzin - Nr.2 Cica Ceramide) and it works nicely after retinol or skincare.

I'm searching for a covering cream or a light foundation to hide redness on my face. I have a sensitive combo skin and many of the foundations i've tried gave me breakouts or greasy/heavy feeling during the day. That's why I think something like a cream would help.

* (sometimes) Centella Madagascar Ampoule -tone with Aúna heart leaf toner pads -Aetobarrier essence
* The Inkey vitamin C serum -Soon Jung 2x barrier intensive cream
* Olay retinol night cream 
* Then in the morning, I just rinse with cold water and apply sunscreen.

1ob7jza,kbeauty,My Minimum Skincare Routine That Finally Helped My Acne-Prone Skin,"Hi K-Beauty Lovers!  
I’ve struggled with acne-prone, sensitive skin for years. I used to layer on so many products hoping for quick results, but nothing worked long term. Eventually, I realized that when your skin barrier is weak, almost everything causes irritation.  
That’s when I started my **“Minimum Skincare Routine.”**  
It’s not about doing less for the sake of it, but about doing only what’s necessary and cutting out anything that stresses my skin. I stopped trying to add more and focused on removing properly. Even if you don’t wear makeup, cleansing thoroughly is everything. Poor cleansing alone can cause breakouts, and I wish I’d known that sooner.  
Now I’ve finally settled on a minimal, effective routine that keeps my skin calm and clear.

1. **Cleanser – FATION Nosca9 Deep Pore Cleansing Foam** This cleanser was a total game-changer for my sensitive skin. It gives true deep pore cleansing without any irritation, and the soft, rich foam feels incredibly soothing even when my skin is breaking out. I love that it leaves my skin moisturized and fresh instead of tight or dry.
2. **Toner – Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner** It’s super lightweight but surprisingly hydrating, helping my skin feel balanced again after washing. I usually pat in two layers, and it instantly calms any redness or irritation.
3. **Cream – Torriden Dive-In Hyaluronic Acid Soothing Cream** It’s fragrance-free and packed with Panthenol and Hyaluronic Acid, so it keeps moisture locked in all day. I love that it hydrates deeply without feeling heavy or clogging pores.
4. **Sunscreen – Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Airfit Daily Sunscreen** The texture is airy and smooth, almost like a light moisturizer. It blends in easily with no white cast, offers SPF 50+, and gives a natural finish that works even under makeup.

If your skin feels overwhelmed, try giving it a break. You might be surprised how much calmer it gets.

Around august, i made my first purchase in Yesstyle, which came incomplete, missing one Romand product. I told Yesstyle custom service and they reshipped the lipgloss, but it never arrived.

I got in contact with yesstyle team and they told me if the package has not arrived by october 17, i should contact them immediately.

Obviously the package never arrived and i got in contact, asking if i could get a refund for the product. But when i got the refund in Yesstyle Credits, i got it for the full order and not only the product, so it seems like there was a misunderstanding.

1o7d5kh,kbeauty,How do I get this kind of hair?,"I hope this is allowed here, I didn’t know where else to go. I always see people online talking about wanting tighter, more defined waves and curls. But I’m honestly more into the looser S shaped waves. I can’t find anything online about how to do that. I’ve listed and example of what I mean. My hair already has loose waves but they’re barrel shaped and I’m not sure how to get them to do the s shape? I’d prefer if rather than heat styling I could do something with my wet hair so it lasts longer, because wet styling makes my hair hold that shape a lot better. I see this style mostly in k-beauty spaces. Basically what I like about this hair is that it’s fluffy and voluminous and soft looking, without the Frizz.

I kind of already have this hair but mine always looks so messy, because it is. I just wake up and don’t do anything to it. The day I wash it it looks quite defined and shiny which I don’t like. But as i get further from that day there’s usually a sweet spot for me where my hair starts getting drier and hence fluffier but still holds its shape so it’s not insane. I don’t know I’m just rambling. I’m not really sure how to go about getting voluminous fluffy hair without the frizz yk? And if there’s a way to get my hair to wave in an “s” shape then I’d like that too, as I think it’s very pretty.

Routine: shampoo and conditioner in the shower, let my hair soak through completely with water and exit the shower so that my hair forms bigger clumps. And I let it air dry. No additional products. Occasionally I use sea salt spray but I’m not sure how to use it correctly and I’m not sure if I’m doing it right.

I have thick 2a/2b hair I think. I’d attach a photo of my hair right now if I could attach more than one picture",Top_Negotiation9170,265,0.99,54,1760539919.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7d5kh,https://reddit.com/r/kbeauty/comments/1o7d5kh/how_do_i_get_this_kind_of_hair/

1opmt5e,AsianBeauty,TirTir Red Cushion Swatches (22C & 23N),"Hello! Just recently started looking for my Tirtir red cushion shade and saw the various posts & comments warning about oxidation, so I thought I'd chime in too.

I am usually a 23 in korean brands, so this made me worry quite a lot. I already purchased the 23N to try and it luckily came with some trial packs, so I was able to try 22C.

Skin info:
- Combination (oily t-zone)
- Warm-leaning undertone

Environment:
- High humidity & hot tropical country 

My foundation shades:
- 23N1 Sand - Etude Double Lasting Foundation
- 03 Natural Glass - Fwee Cushion Glass Natural

Tirtir's 23N made me look like I had a spray tan on upon immediate application. I always found other Neutral shades to be too cool for me, so I was shocked to see how ""orange"" 23N truly was. The reviews were right about that!

However, despite that, it actually barely oxidized on my skin, with or without primer. Though after 40 mins 23N looks a *little* bit warmer in person than my camera could capture, it really wasn't by a lot like I've seen in other way older photos.

I took a chance on 22C because I figured Tirtir's red shades leaned warm anyway, that C might work! AND IT DID! It was a perfect match upon initial application, and it didn't or barely oxidized after a few hours of wear. I find it wild that I matched with a C, but I'm just accepting that Tirtir's colors are their own system and not to use it with other brands.

From the top, Orange(AI Filter Cushion), Red cushion, Silver (Aura Cushion) and Pink (All-Cover Cushion.

The orange cushion is VERY ORANGE. 

Their website doesn't allow a review under 4 stars, but Shopify does so the reviews are far less glowing.

Very annoying they won't give a refund, I now have a very orange cushion that I have no idea how I'll be able to use it. The red cushion is right on me, the silver cushion I warm up (it goes a bit pink on me) with powder. The pink and orange just came so I don't know how it'll go on my face. But that orange is EESH. I wouldn't even expect that after oxidising.

1oogcwn,AsianBeauty,2025 empties,"Bunch of empties from this year, some opened already in late 2024. I have a dehydrated combo skin and live in Northern Europe in coastal climate, where winters are especially awful to my skin due to cold outside and central heating inside.

Unfortunately I have no idea at this point how long things took to pan, I've been meaning to make this post for months. :') But gave my best guesstimate.

* Cosrx:
   * The 6 Peptide Skin Booster: nice step before other products, made my skin feel softer and slightly brighter. WRP, 10 months irregular use.
   * Propolis Synergy Toner: really nice soothing and hydrating toner, liked it especially during the winter. MRP, a year with very infrequent use.
* Tirtir The Mask Fit Make Up Fixer: I've used two bottles of this so far and it's kept my makeup from separating so works as intended in a non-humid climate. WRP, 5 months with almost daily use.
* Skin Aqua:
   * Super Moisture UV Gel (white and blue): HG sunscreen, lightweight and easy to apply, doesn't leave me feeling sticky. WRP, 2 months with daily use.
   * Sunplay UV Super Moisture Gel: I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea how this differs from the other one except maybe the smell, but it was a good sunscreen and I really enjoyed it. WNRP as I buy the other one now lol. Several months with infrequent use
* Curél Deep Moisture Spray x2: this is my first step after getting out of shower and it provides me the immediate relief my skin needs before I can get other products sorted. HG, I love this stuff. WRP, about 3 months with daily use.
* Naturie:
   * Skin Conditioner: HG watery toner, best layered. WRP, \~4 months with daily use.
   * Skin Conditioning Gel: I use this as a hydrating serum, and it feels so nice and soothing especially if I'm a little flushed. WRP, 6 months with daily use.
   * Skin Conditioning Milk: just realized I already included this in my previous empties post since it was ""almost empty"" in March. It lasted from June until end of May, unbelievable value for money. Use it as the AM moisturizer. WRP, almost a damn year with daily use.
* Sana Nameraka Honpo mist toner: I emptied a bigger version of this earlier, and now finished the small one. Used mainly on my body as I disliked it on my face. WNRP, use Curel now. Year with very infrequent use.
* dear, Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream in mini and jumbo: HG PM moisturizer, a little goes a long way. WRP, usually about 4 months with daily use.
* Shiseido Urea hand/foot cream in tube and jar: I love this stuff for my feet, it's thick but sinks in so well and doesn't leave stickiness. WRP
* Ihada:
   * Otona no Nikibi acne cream: this did help some of my inflamed pimples calm down and bring them to head - it's not a miracle cream but I liked it better than Lion Pair. WRP, almost a year with frequent use.
   * Yakuyo Night Pack: super thick moisturizer that I slapped on my cheeks on top of the Klairs cream during winter and woke up without feeling like my face was going to shrivel off. WRP, five months with daily use.
* Chi-Chi Miyahira hand cream: nice basic hand cream I got as a souvenir from Okinawa. Liked the lime & shikuwasa scent. WNRP
* Canmake Quick Lash Curler x3: my HG mascara, I like the small size, the wand, and that it's basically bomb proof. WRP, one lasts several months with almost daily use.
* Heroine Make Speedy mascara remover x2: the only thing that can get the Canmake mascara off. WRP, about 5 months with almost daily use.
* (not pictured) Muji Mild Cleansing Oil refill x2 (pre-reformulation): HG cleansing oil, incredibly mad it was reformulated. I have one more pouch of the old formula that I'm saving until I absolutely need to use it lol. About 4 months per refill pouch. WNRP unless they fix what they did to it.
* (not pictured) Kose Make Keep Mist ex cool: good make up fixer, MRP if I can find some other limited edition scent that isn't as offensive to me as the regular rose smell. 4 months with almost daily use.

Not completely emptied but used until no longer working:

* Iromikke liquid eyeliner: this brand was my surprise find from Donki last year and I've since bought several of their liquid eyeliners. Fun colors, really good glide, and stay on well enough for their 500JPY price. I had this color for a year but it wasn't suiting me as much as I hoped so used it until the package started leaking. WRP but not in this color.
* Kate Tokyo super sharp liner: it's a good eyeliner and super pigmented. Had it for a little over a year until it started to dry out. The brown color was too dark for me so WNRP.
* Rom&nd Nu Zero cushion: I could never get this sit nicely on my skin, it always pilled or started to separate. Used it for three to four months until I couldn't take it anymore and bought a better foundation.

So I wanted a perspective on this from other people, do sunscreen always leave a shiny finish even if they claim they are matte? Are there sunscreens which don't have any shine at all? Are there any ways to minimise the shine? 

Because I also feel like there's judgement to some degree as well when my face has that shine from the sunscreen.

I’ve had PIH over my back like this for at least 6 months - 1 year now. From old acne. Would love to reduce their appearance! Especially the brown part.

I went to one skin clinic who has offered me peel (AHA +- BHA) + picolaser as spot treatment each session. VS another skin clinic who has said we could try peels for the first few sessions, then if it doesn’t work, pico laser.

I’ve also just had a Tele consult with a clinic who said pico only.
Have come here for your opinions / advice! What would be most helpful for this (peels alone, picolaser as spot treatment only, peels and laser in one session VS peels then laser)?

And how many sessions do you think it’ll take and realistically how much improvement do you think I’ll have?

1oo3c28,AsianBeauty,Which one of these lip tints/glosses are worth the money?,"Hi, I’m almost done with my Romand Custard Mauve after almost a year of use and I'm looking to buy a new lip tint/gloss from one of these 6 below.

I don’t want to overspend or hoard too many since that’d be wasteful. And I’m currently doing a self-restraint challenge to actually finish the ones I own before buying more.

The lip tint in order:

1. Peripera Ink Glasting Lip Gloss – 06 Made It
2. Heart Percent Dote On Mood One Way Glowy Tint
3. Dinto Blur-Glowy Lip Tint
4. Laka Fruity Glam Tint
5. fwee 3D Voluming Gloss
6. Entropy Charm Tint Glossy Gel

I’ve done a bit of research, and here’s what I’ve found so far:

* **Dinto Blur-Glowy Lip Tint**: Many say it’s a great tint, but a lot of people warn that the official swatches look very different from how it appears on the lips. I’ve watched lip and hand swatches, and the same shade seems to look completely different on everyone.
* **Laka Fruity Glam Tint**: I’ve mostly heard good things about this one, but from what I’ve seen with all the swatches, the shades lean either too bright pink or too warm.
* **Heart Percent Dote On Mood One Way Glowy Tint**: I love the colors, but there aren’t many reviews. Some mention that it’s quite sheer for a tint, and you need to layer it a lot to match the swatches.
* **Entropy Charm Tint Glossy Gel**: Seems to be a hit or miss. Some love it, but others think it’s overpriced for what it offers. I’ve also heard that the scent and taste aren’t very pleasant.
* **fwee 3D Voluming Gloss**: Mostly positive reviews, though I’ve seen a few swatches where the color looks uneven on the lips.
* **Peripera Ink Glasting Lip Gloss (06 Made It)**: I really love the color, but I’ve heard it’s very sheer and sticky. Plus, Peripera lip products tend to oxidize and discolor faster than others.

1ons546,AsianBeauty,Holy grail serum/ cream / mask for aging well,"

Hello everyone, I hope you are all well.

I'm reaching out because I'd like to know which products you've found to be truly effective (aside from retinol) for treating the first signs of wrinkles and fine lines and firming the skin.

Which serum/cream or mask brightens, moisturizes, firms the skin, and really works for skin in its thirties?

What are your favorite products that have really delivered results?



Thank you for your help :)",shineyourlight89,54,0.95,47,1762213677.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1ons546/holy_grail_serum_cream_mask_for_aging_well/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1ons546/holy_grail_serum_cream_mask_for_aging_well/

1onh1on,AsianBeauty,Light-Medium Coverage SPF,"Wondering what everyone’s go-to products are for a quick UV foundation on your light natural makeup days. 

I’ll go first. Both in pic above, They have high SPF while giving a light to medium coverage (foundation type of thing). I love both as they’re sweatproof, stay on the whole day, no creasing or wrinkling. 
 I’ve used both products in the pic above (Shiseido BB for sports / Allie sheer beige for face) as my single SPF product after my morning skincare routine. Not at the same time. It’s an either or situation.

1omrftv,AsianBeauty,Discovered that I’m sensitive to butylene glycol 🧴,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience just in case it might help someone. I once read here on Reddit that someone broke out from butylene glycol. Didn’t think much of it at the time, but for some reason I remembered. 

When I got into Korean skincare, I noticed that almost every time I tried a new product, I’d get small breakouts. Not acne, more like closed comedones or tiny whiteheads on my cheeks and temples (which is not my usual acne area). When I went back to my old routine, they disappeared. I was super bummed because I just couldn’t get the hype… Everyone was discovering amazing products while my skin acted up every time I introduced something new. And then I remembered that post about butylene glycol. Many Korean products seem to have butylene glycol high on the list, while my previous products didn’t. I cut it out completely, and within a week my skin started improving. Seems that I have a sensitivity towards this ingredient that I wasn’t aware of. 

So if you’re dealing with mysterious breakouts, it might be worth checking if you’re sensitive to butylene glycol. It seems to show up a lot more in Korean skincare than in many European brands. I still love Korean skincare, but it just means I have to dig a bit deeper into the ingredient list now hehe 😫",lindathegr3atest,54,0.97,19,1762114147.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1omrftv/discovered_that_im_sensitive_to_butylene_glycol/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1omrftv/discovered_that_im_sensitive_to_butylene_glycol/

1omnh0q,AsianBeauty,Am I missing something? Sample sizes….,"So upon discovering that the Amore Pacific Essence is discontinued and trying to stock up I’ve found something which I was confused about.

I had previously bought some from EBay and shipped from Korea so decided to have a look and see what options there was that wasn’t buying full price for a smaller bottle at a department store when I visit New York next month.

I’d bought a jumbo size previously but can’t see any available, I can see 2x120ml for £250 or thereabouts but then I see lots of listings for 5ml samples - there are places selling packs of 9 sample sizes for about £15 and I can get 50 of the 5ml size for £150! Is there any reason that this is too good to be true? 

The same sellers seem to sell lots of sample bundles of higher end skincare and all are shipped from Korea so maybe it’s just easier for those businesses to have access to more sample sizes?

1olkyfk,AsianBeauty,Mise En Scene hello bubble primer - review,"Just recently used the Mise En Scene hair primer and wanted to leave a review :]

Before: grown out roots at a level 3 and dye on the ends from January (garnier nutrisse cappuccino colour - not AB) maybe at a level 4?
After: 1 round of primer, I’d say my hair is at a level 6 with orange undertones (just basing it off this specific hair chart) 

Experience: So I did a patch test 48 hours beforehand (based off instructions) which was pretty simple, however since it is bleach my skin did feel a bit uncomfortable but nothing like a chemical burn.  It didn’t smell strongly of chemicals to me, and kinda reminded me of like sherbet candy (sort of pleasant actually). I bought 3 boxes just in case I’d run out but 1 box just barely managed to generously cover my past chest length hair.  Started off at the ends (the heat fron the scalp develops the dye faster, so I left roots for last), application was fairly easy (this was my first time using a bubble formula, and I much prefer it over the liquid). Left on for a few minutes longer than the recommended 30 and washed out. 

Current shampoo and conditioner I use are the Off&Relax moisturise specifically the early grey AND I RECOMMEND IT SM, it makes my hair silky smooth. After washing it off and conditioning I’d say it did feel a tad bit dry-er but it didn’t feel like harsh damage at all, especially after putting the Mise en scene perfect serum on. Despite doing the ends before, my roots still came out a bit lighter, though that’s user error and I’ll be sure to just wait a few minutes before doing my roots for better evenness. 

Overall I’d give it a solid 4.5/5, definitely going to reach for more colours after my hair grows out again. I think my hair lifts quite easily, so results could vary. 

I’m going to go through another round in 5 days and then dye Matt brown a few days after that so I’ll most likely update if anyone is interested :]",Cultural_Ad_9420,124,0.97,4,1761994698.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olkyfk,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olkyfk/mise_en_scene_hello_bubble_primer_review/
1om3wcx,AsianBeauty,Help me AB detectives!,"Two months ago I unwittingly threw away my HG cleanser and I have been suffering ever since. I’m hoping someone here will recognize the details and save me from my unending breakouts. 

The unknown: Where it came from. I am annoyingly unfaithful, and buy from Stylevana, YesStyle, and Olive Young. I also do not always log in to make purchases (WHY) and this cleanser is not in any of my order histories. I tend to buy random things based on reviews or vibes. 

The known: It was a white, milky cleanser in a tall plastic clear pump dispenser, with a black pump. It dispensed as gel, not as foam. There’s copy on the bottle that says you can apply it directly as a first step, or foam in your hands to use as a second step. I still have the pump dispenser and you can see some of the remaining product, it was almost kind of pearlescent. 

In my memory the branding and bottle looked like Pyankang Yul style - simple, pared back black copy on a clear bottle. It is definitely not Pyankung Yul because their foaming cleanser is what set off my current barrier issues. 

You are my only hope. I had no idea this cleanser was the reason my skin had been clear for months and I absolutely must have it back. ",raghaillach,4,0.54,38,1762044119.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1om3wcx,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1om3wcx/help_me_ab_detectives/

1oljn31,AsianBeauty,My bath routine : cleasner & washoff pack,"As the weather’s been getting colder, my skin started breaking out a bit, so I decided to change up my bath routine. I’ll be sharing my reviews of the products I’ve used so far. I’m so touched that everyone liked my arm shot. Well, to be honestly, you guys like a shot of the product’s texture, though!

**1. Numbuzin Cleansing Oil** : I bought this because I heard cleansing oils help remove whiteheads. It worked well for me no irritation, and it suited my skin. I also tried using it for a scalp massage before shampooing, and surprisingly, it really worked! Since my skin is a bit irritated these days, I’ve paused using it for now.

**2. Make P:rem Cleansing Milk** : I switched to this after finishing my previous cleansing milk. It’s gentle and non-irritating. It doesn’t remove makeup completely, but since I wash my face with soap after cleansing milk, I’m satisfied with it overall.

**3. powder cleanser** : I bought this after seeing it on youtube. I use it about once a week when my skin feels rough or flaky, and I’m quite happy with the result. It’s a bit bothersome to use, so I don’t reach for it often.

**4. Wash-off Masks** : I always use a wash-off mask once a week. It’s honestly the most important part of my bath time. Here are some of the products I’ve been using, both old favorites and new ones since my skin got irritated recently.

**4-1. Mary & May Cica Wash-off Mask** : I loved the Cica sheet masks from mary&may, so I tried this one too. It feels super soft and it has tiny beads that make your skin feel deeply cleansed. Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin. my main wash off mask is currently this one! def recommend it!

**4-2. Whipped Vegan Pack Scrub** : As the name suggests, it has fine beads that help exfoliate. I used it once a week when my skin was healthy, but I avoid it when my skin feels sensitive.

**4-3. Skinfood Strawberry Mas**k : This one also has small granules like the Whipped pack, so it helps with gentle exfoliation. It’s softer than the Whipped one, but the exfoliating power is mild. I mainly use it when I want that sweet strawberry scent.

**4-4. Skinfood Apricot Mask** : It’s very soft and moisturizing, though it doesn’t make my skin feel super clean. It seems more soothing and calming.

**5. Jojoba Oil** : I heard it’s great for oily skin, so I tried it, but unlike cleansing oil, it doesn’t rinse off easily. If anyone knows a good way to use jojoba oil, please share!

My skin often gets irritated, so I change my skincare routine quite often. It’s a bit of a hassle, but it really helps my skin calm down and recover faster. Since skin regenerates every 28 days, I think using scrub masks once or twice a week (depending on your skin condition) works best. I’m curious if others use cleansing or wash-off masks regularly too. They’ve been helping me a lot, so I’ll keep using them. Please share your own bath routines!

1olb23a,AsianBeauty,Chinese skincare - some thoughts from a visit,"I recently returned from a trip to China, where I looked into local skincare products and cosmetic procedures. Here are some of my observations.

**Drugstores and supermarkets**

Overall, the skincare products in supermarkets and pharmacies were not remarkable or revolutionary. They were similar to those available in other countries, and the choice in many supermarkets was limited.

I was particularly interested in Chinese-made products. I observed a few things about them:

* they were often heavily fragranced
* they came in small bottles
* they were not particularly cheap.

I did notice some unique ingredients. I saw caviar used in skincare lotions, which I had not seen before. One product was also advertised as containing rare earth elements.

Common international brands like CeraVe, Nivea, and L'Oréal were available in some pharmacies and high-end supermarkets, but they were marketed as premium skincare.

The selection of Chinese-made sunscreen was also limited and did not seem innovative, unlike in Japan. Most of the options available were high-quality Japanese brands.

**Luxury market**

China has a growing luxury skincare market. Large malls feature all the major international brands, just as you would find in any other major city. I was surprised to see extensive advertising and retail stalls for SkinCeuticals, an American brand. The products were not any cheaper than in America, but they were very heavily marketed.

**Medicated skincare**

Many dermatological topical medications were available over the counter. I was able to buy Tretinoin (though only in a very small tube) and Adapalene without a prescription. Moderately potent steroid creams were also available. Otherwise, I did not notice any remarkable or unfamiliar medications. I was not focused on exploring traditional Chinese natural medicines.

**Cosmetic procedures**

Demand for cosmetic procedures is growing in major cities, with many clinics offering these services. Cosmetic dermatological treatments were often provided alongside plastic surgery. Skin booster treatments, mesotherapy, and fillers were available. Lifting treatments were also available, but perhaps not to the same extent as in South Korea.

I was interested to see fillers being used as skin boosters. One such product was BIOHYALUX (润百颜), a 2.0mL sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) solution with lidocaine, produced by 华熙生物科技股份有限公司 (Huaxi Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).

I saw mesotherapy performed with a suction gun, known as a ""water-light"" (水光针) injector. I noted one manufacturer was Bloomage Biotech, and the device made the procedure very comfortable.

For neurotoxins, American (Botox) and German (Xeomin) brands were available, alongside a considerably cheaper Chinese version. I was also very interested to see neurotoxin being used as a skin booster, a procedure known as ""micro-botox"".",Kiwi_In_The_Comments,156,0.93,10,1761958131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olb23a/chinese_skincare_some_thoughts_from_a_visit/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olb23a/chinese_skincare_some_thoughts_from_a_visit/

1okzjan,AsianBeauty,Taiwan & Korea contact lens haul and review,"Product list in order (left to right): OPT (Bega Milk Brown), Largan (Mature), Largan (Fancy), Hapa Kristin (One & Only Grey), Lensme (Blonty Brown)

Picked up a ton of coloured contacts during my recent travels to Taiwan and Korea, and my only regret is not buying more (especially from Taiwan)! As someone who has insanely high myopia + chronically dry, sensitive eyes I've always had to specially order contacts from local optometrists. But I was mad impressed by how Taiwanese and Korean places carry lenses up to -10.00 and how easy it is to buy contacts.

Overall, the Korean lenses were really pretty, but the Taiwanese ones really blew me away in terms of colour choices, comfort, and price point! My only issue that it's a lot less accessible outside of Taiwan (sobs). Everything I got was dailies, and the product list and in-depth reviews are below!

1. OPT travel journal series in Bega Milk Brown (Taiwan) - 4.5/5 ⭐️

Retails for TWD250 / ~USD8 per box (10 lenses), but they always have a promo if you buy 2 boxes. This colour has a very ""foxy"" quality to it, and is noticeable without being too over the top. The lenses were super comfortable; I wore them out for 15 hours, and though my eyes were tired they weren't extremely dry. I rated this a 4 out of 5 because it's not a true everyday lens for me, and you really need makeup to pull this off. But would definitely purchase other colours from OPT!


2. Largan starry series dailies in Mature (Taiwan) - 4/5 ⭐️
Retails for TWD349 / ~USD11.5 per box, but like OPT they were running promos for 2 boxes. The shade ""Mature"" is a warm brown with a hint of pink in the inner rim, and looks super natural. In fact, it's so natural that I barely noticed any difference with my regular eye colour. These lenses are really comfortable, and lasted me 12 hours with no issue. 


3. Largan starry series dailies in Fancy (Taiwan) - 5/5 ⭐️

My absolute favourite lenses out of everything I got. No contest. The comfort and colour are just *chef's kiss*. This is an olive colour with a brown base, and I have no idea how the manufacturer just makes it blend into my eyes. Like you suspect I'm wearing coloured contacts, but can't really be sure of it. This is the product I got multiple backups of even though there were no discounts, and if I run out of this I will be devastated.


4. Hapa Kristin dailies in One & Only Grey (Korea) - 3.5/5 ⭐️

The iconic Wonyoung lenses! This retails for 19000 won / ~USD13 per box (10 pieces). Unfortunately they weren't doing any promos for dailies when I was in Korea. This is a very pretty, everyday lens where the grey in the inner iris almost turns silver when the light hits it a certain way. However this wasn't as comfortable as the Taiwanese lenses; they didn't irritate my eyes, but their presence was a lot more noticeable. Might work better for someone with less sensitive eyes.


5. Lensme in Blonty Brown (Korea) - 3.8/5 ⭐️

This brand was recommended by xiaohongshu, and so I listened. This retails for 19000 won / ~USD13 per box (10 pieces), and the colour is very similar to OPT's Bega Milk Brown, just that this is a touch more noticeable with the darker border. Lensme was more comfortable than Hapa Kristin, but similarly they had a more noticeable presence on the eyes compared to the Taiwanese lenses. Still, I wore this out for 12 hours with no issues. Probably not a go-to brand for me, but I wouldn't mind picking up another colour.


TLDR; Product ranking:
1. Largan dailies in ""Fancy""
2. OPT dailies in ""Bega Milk Brown""
3. Largan dailies in ""Mature""
4. Lensme in ""Blonty Brown""
5. Hapa Kristin in ""One & Only Grey""",blueee24,135,0.99,23,1761928809.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okzjan,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1okzjan/taiwan_korea_contact_lens_haul_and_review/

1oksk0u,AsianBeauty,Never ordering from Yesstyle again,"I've used Yesstyle since 2016, and while the ordering time and customer service was never great, items always arrived. Sometimes they were disappointing, so I limited my purchases to only beauty products. 

In late September I restocked some skincare staples (I only buy the items that claim to ship within 21 hours), and the parcel was marked as shipped on 02 October. Since it usually takes a while for tracking to be updated, I gave it three weeks, but there was no update, no parcel, nothing. After writing to customer service, I received a message that they might take some time to respond, but I received my answer a few days later: the order was not shipped at all, because they needed to verify my address. I wrote back to them four days ago and am still waiting for a reply. 

Meanwhile my moisturizer is running out, I'm debating whether to order it from a different website for now while waiting for Yesstyle to ship my parcel (then wait a few weeks more for delivery to Europe), but I did budget for this order. I'm not really happy about having to spend more money. 

It's ridiculous that they did not ship my parcel for over a month, despite marking it shipped, and mind you, this was all for in-stock products.

1oktxp8,AsianBeauty,"Rom&nd launched (another) new collection, w/ZO Friends (BBK)","Hey just thought if anyone wanted to know I got the email notification earlier this evening from Beauty Box Korea that Rom&nd has a new collection (it's big) w/ZO Friends and there are some new shades across multiple lines and yes I made sure to buy what I wanted first before telling you LOL. I marked as spoilers in case you don't want to know the names or colours. I will discuss/list some that I've ordered/appeal below. Not their liner pots or the Uriage balms either, but a full-on collection.

Highlights for me: 

Glasting Gloss new shades: 19 Joy Berry and 20 Cloud Mint. Um, so a bit basic but glad to have them. Also, a bit annoyed at that Glasting Gloss, given I just recently ordered a similar green colour from their mini Glasting Gloss collection (15 Mugwort Songpyeon). I've not got either yet to compare. Don't forget obligatory 01 Peony Ballet (again) but with a cartoon on it (again).  
  
Glasting Balm: I wish this was some fun grey stuff or colour change stuff but it's just colour mixing I think or maybe a little pH from the grey and then the rest of the other colour (the balms have two colours mixed in) turns them into fairly standard Rom&nd/Korean colours. Too light for my taste but I've ordered them. 19 Pink Jelly (Light sort of Peony Pink) and 20 Daisy Jelly (Coral/Peachy). 

The Juicy Lasting Tint(s):  
05 Bare Fig (repeat)  
29 Joseon Fig (repeat)  
36 Kitten Lychee (cute looking pink lilac)  
37 Guava Daisy (don't even try it Rom&nd. MORE GUAVA? MORE?)  
38 Cloud Berry (Grey. If that stays grey, I'm going to be very happy, even if I dislike TJLT formula and probably just could've dealt w/Black Sesame Jeolpyeon)

The new eye palette looks cute (one is a repeat, 05 Shade & Shadow Garden): 15 Kitten Cloud Garden. This isn't my specialty, I'm the lip person...but I don't rate their formula highly as a Westerner I have 2 palettes and a quad and don't use much, but I sort of wish I got it now...I panic ordered the lips as soon as was notified LOL.

There's 2 highlighters and they look really pretty but if I have another white/icy/silver highlight my Alex Draws will collapse: 01 Cloud White and 02 Paw Pink.

Juicy Roll Cheek has 2 new shades and now I'm annoyed I didn't get 'em too: 08 Kitten Grape and 09 Kitten Daisy. Kitty Daisy is right up my cool-tone alley.

There's Han brow stuff and limited edition Zero Cushion covers too, only in 21 and 23. That's annoying, but also 17 is too dark for me anyway.

I'm a bit Rom&nd fatigued, tbh. I had to buy all their TJLT minis, half of their mini Glasting Glosses 'cos I'm broke, then the other half (still coming from BBK), all 3 of the Volume Hack kits a few months ago, I feel like Tanning whatever collection wasn't all that long ago either, 13 Guava Cream and 14 Muige in full size Glasting Gloss (it's nice tho), 10 Shell Brown in their Lip Liner and the 2 Uriage Balm collabs (Barrier Grape, Juju Barrier). Now this. It's a big collection. Lucky I'm just a lip person with them mostly now.

1okmc9n,AsianBeauty,[Review] Beplain Cicaterol Ampoule - my skin barrier is stable,"**\*\* I can finally post on Asian Beauty!!!** 

Hi everyone! Today I wanted to share one of my absolute favorite calming products. I first discovered this through a Youtuber I follow, but I was already pretty familiar with Beplain as a brand since I've been using their foam and cleansing oil for a while! After trying this ampoule for myself, I can confidently say - it's amazing!

I'm already on my second bottle and heading into month 3, so I figured it's time to give it a proper review.

I have super tricky skin - seborrheic dermatitis, gets overheated easily, sensitive + combo skin that flips out once a month like clockwork. Since I started using this ampoule, I barely get those ""skin freakout"" episodes anymore.

The biggest change is that it feels like I actually have a skin barrier now. My.face feels soft even before and after washing (never felt that before!) and I get way fewer breakouts.

Even though I use a few things, this ampoule is the MVP - It's the one thing I feel really made my skin calmer and stronger.

Also, the instant calming effect is real - redness literally disappears within a few minutes of applying. No irritation, no stinging, just soothing. Works for all seasons and doesn't feel heavy on my oily T-zone.

I actually bought it during an Olive Young sale. I mostly use it on my forehead where I break out the most, and it noticeably flattens angry spots overnight!

1okqpil,AsianBeauty,can i just use the product straight from the refill pouch?,"Hello, new here! I've been looking for a lightweight moisturizer to switch out my current really thick one and I've decided to go back to an old moisturizer I used to use. It comes in a 50ml airless pump jar, the refills are plastic pouches with a screw cap, and I still have an old empty jar in my possession. That being said there are parts of an airless pump jar that are basically uncleanable right, and overtime product can build up in those books and crannies. 

I've read that you shouldn't refill the main packaging forever, but that leads me to wonder why I/we should buy the main packaging at all??? The refill pouch says it's good to use up to a year after opening too. I know the jar is sturdier and prettier but is there any actual downside to just squeezing out the moisturizer from the pouch, no jar?

I would love to hear other people's thoughts on this!",_rainangel,9,0.91,8,1761905749.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1okqpil/can_i_just_use_the_product_straight_from_the/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1okqpil/can_i_just_use_the_product_straight_from_the/

1ok2p0m,AsianBeauty,UK might remove the £135 tax-free import rule? What does that mean for stylevana orders?,"Hey! I keep seeing news that the uk might get rid of the current rule where overseas parcels under £135 don’t get charged customs/duty when they arrive. Supposedly it’s being aimed at companies like temu, but I’m wondering if it could affect all the k/j-beauty we order from places like stylewvana, yesstyle, jolse, etc?

Like… if we order a cleanser from hong kong or korea that’s worth £20, will customs/vat fees start being added on top once it gets to the uk?

Just curious if anyone understands what this change would mean, will prices go up? Or is it more of a “wait and see” situation?

1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?,"So I have seen Dermatologists on on instagram and I have seen the following general recommendations for a routine:

AM: 
- water “cleanse” (or regular cleanse if needed for certain skin types)
- vitamin C
- optional: lotion
- sunscreen

PM:
- cleanse
- retinoid
- lotion

Optional:
- all sorts of things from hyaluronic acid to niacinimide to azelaic acid

I know the obvious answer is “do what your skin needs” BUT how do you structure your routines? How do you do the research to know what works (vs is a trend or a new-ish thing like PDRN) and pick products to try?

I personally am a maximalist learning to become a minimalist.

We would like to note that product packaging AND formulas may vary by country of sale and date of manufacture. This might include anything about the formula. Our goal is to make it easier for folks to compare such things, and to confirm or assuage concerns about their products.

Please post any photos or experiences you have around your AB products, while adhering to our other subreddit rules.

Make sure you state where you purchased your products from. If you bought from a 3rd party of a major retailer, you can say for example, 'eBay/amazon/taobao seller' instead of sharing the specific name, if you prefer.

To help you get more responses, consider including:

* Photos of confirmed authentic products as comparison, requests for authentic products are allowed
* Your purchase date, product manufacture date, or any expiration dates
