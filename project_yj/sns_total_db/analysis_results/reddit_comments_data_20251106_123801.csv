I have the same type and have used these for almost a year, my skin never looked better. They are high quality products, and come in large quantity, while being very budget friendly! The toner is 500ml for about US $20, and cream is 300ml for about US $12. I know it seems expensive, but keep in mind that most Korean toners are about 250ml for that same price, and with TONYMOLY you are getting DOUBLE (they also have smaller sizes available for lower prices)! While most Korean moisturizers are 150ml for about US $20. Again, you are getting double with TONYMOLY and for half the price. 😁 they will last you a good amount of time even with using 2x daily because they are so big! Plus, your skin and wallet will thank you. If you wait for Black Friday, they will go on sale on Amazon and Ulta, for super cheap. 110% worth it, if you ask me. 😅💕 I am not sure what form of dollars RS is, Rupees or Rubles? Otherwise I would have converted the amount for you, my bad.

My last opinion is that if you are trying to remain frugal, instead of using eye cream, use your toner, serums, and moisturizer on your eyes as well. Also, look into possibly purchasing reusable eye masks. The ones from We Love Eyes, are a bit expensive, but you can use them for a year or more! Just apply whatever skincare product you use on your eyes (doesn’t have to be eye serum), and apply the reusable masks! Take off after 30 minutes, clean, and repeat tomorrow. 🙂 not only do they help reduce waste, but you get a year+ of unlimited uses for only USD $20. Regular eye masks cost about the same price per tub, usually come with 60 masks, giving you 30 days one time use, or 15 days if you use them morning and night.

It might be totally fine for you, and not break out at all! 🤷🏻‍♀️ you won’t know until you try it 🥰 the COSRX 92 Advanced Cream leaves your skin so silky smooth, it’s insane.

The trick with snail mucin is that you have to apply it to a damp face, but not dripping wet like after washing. Like immediately after applying toner, or spritz your face with some water in a spray bottle. For whatever reason, if you apply it to a dry face, it will be super sticky and not able to absorb properly. I dunno why, lol

COSRX also produces a lot of other really good products that do not contain snail mucin. Their propolis toner is fantastic, the overnight lip balm works really well, and they just released a ceramide skincare line that I have not yet tried myself, but I hear from my friends is amazing.

nnah4n3,1omp5fu,kbeauty,djnoelxx,"Milk cleansers.

Foam cleansers are harsh on the skin because the bubbles are so dense, especially if they are not emulsified properly. Like if I just squeezed some out of the tube into my hands and immediately rubbed it on the face, that is actually very bad for the skin, like rubbing sand paper. If you absolutely have to use a foam, consider buying a marshmallow whip maker to emulsify the bubbles before using it on your face. This will thin the density of them, making it less irritating to the skin. They are cheap, I purchased a two pack on Amazon for US $5, and use one for my shampoo.

If you are willing to try milk cleansers, the biggest one I could find for cheapest price is Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser. It is actually my favorite cleanser EVARR, and what I currently use. I used to use foams, and had horribly oily TZone that looked like I had chicken grease on my face, with cheeks as dry as the Gobi Desert. When I switched to Isntree Milk cleanser, within two weeks my skin calmed down dramatically! Less oily, and my cheeks were not dry anymore! Within three weeks, my skin type did a complete 360, and for the first time in my life I had a normal skin type! My skin became balanced and the skin barrier repaired itself.

nnaf6yx,1omp5fu,kbeauty,djnoelxx,"This is entirely FALSE, and only a matter of opinion, not truth or honesty. Toners are not “literally water”, or a waste of money. Please, do not fall for that! Are toners a totally necessary skincare step? No, they are not. They are completely optional depending on the consumer’s preference. Is the only ingredient in toners literally water? No. Peek at the ingredients list. You will find water as one of the main ingredients, yes, but that is because you have to create things with a base foundation. There are also a whole lot more ingredients in them than just that.

Like with cooking for example.. are cakes literally just flour? No. They have eggs, milk, sugar, and other ingredients to make them flavored and tasty! Right? 😋 haha

Think of toners as the first step of moisturizing your skin after cleansing. They are more like thin serums. Yes, they are optional for those who do not want or need to use them, but I promise you that they are not just “literally water”. 💕

People not well versed in skincare (I am not saying this about you, OP, I mean people in general) frequently have this misconception about toners because most of them are clear, and the brands promote marketing of “thin, watery consistency”. It is easily misunderstood if they do not do the research.

Some people also think this because when they use toners, they are expecting to reap crazy results from them almost immediately. Then they get upset when they don’t see the results they want. This just doesn’t happen for *any* product of *any* kind overnight. It takes time for things to produce changes, especially with skincare products. Just like with medicine, it can take skincare items up to a month, or even three months, for one to see the benefits of it. Consistency and patience is mando.

The last and biggest reason why people fall for this misconception is simply because of opinionated statements on social media, and the sheep effect. Don’t be a sheep my dear 🥰

nmml3mk,1olxqvi,kbeauty,NatsukiSings,"Hi! For starters, I have combination skin, thin, prone to dehydration and sensitive. Also, I HATE the feeling of creams on my face, so I always look for light finishes.

I love the Purito Deep Sea Pure Water cream, but the've changed the packaging and, I guess, the formula too. I don't know about the new one. The old one feels light, soft, almost fake, like it's not gonna hydrate. But it does. You just need a bit, like a pea or two for the whole face and it gets absorbed like a charm. And the hydration lasts. It has niacinamide and panthenol and its soothing, so it calms my skins redness. 10/10. Gonna pray they haven't changed the formula.  
The Centella Unscented Recovery cream is also a favourite of mine, mostly during winter, when the Deep Sea one is not enough (in summer the Centella one is too heavy as I live in a VERY humid place). It's a must for sensitive skins or damaged skin barriers. During summer, if my skin gets burned, I use this and the burn heals super fast. Love it. But they've changed the packaging too T\_T  
The Dermide Relief cream is a bit too thick for my liking as a daily moisturizer, but a great help when a specific spot on my face is specially dry or sensitive or when I wanna make a cream/serum more heavy (for ex, if the climate changes for a few days and it gets very dry).   
I also used Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I liked it very much. You can modulate how heavy or light it feels because you can apply more than one layer and it still gets absorbed (unlike Purito's Centella or Dermide Relief, or other creams I've tried, that you put more on your face and just.....sit there, pilling on top of each other). Purito's Deep Sea (old version) is like this too. It's gonna be my salvation if the Deep Sea has changed :\_)  
I also have Purito's Oat In Calming cream but, AGAIN, they've changed the formula. But I've heard great things about the gel version. I've heard it has the best of the cream and it's lighter, so........... Imma buy it soon xD

The Deep Sea would be my top recommendation. With it's formula, it helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skintone, inflamation and hydration. It should still be a great hydrating cream. If not, the Klairs is great, but only for hydration.",1,1762044811.0,Best Korean day moisturisers of 2025?

nmtt3d5,1ojib0a,kbeauty,pixi3strawb_,"Hi! So a few days ago I received my erborian bb cream and did a wear test from 11 am until 8 pm! I would say that the bb cream is not bad, i think i just got a bit hesitant because the shade is bit lighter than me (i got the nude one because it’s the darkest that i could find) upon application i think it’s a bit overwhelming for me because it’s kinda thicker than the missha one but it’s still manageable as long as u apply them thinly! But on the other side, i got a small acne on my left cheek after using it but tbh idk if it’s really caused by the erborian cream (i did not experienced this with missha when i first tried it) 

For the overall experience, i would say that it’s the same with the missha one! I think it has a sheer to buildable coverage, and in my case, i only applied a thin layer to even out my skin and because the shade is a bit lighter for me. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin as well and did not peeled off (this might depend on your skin prep) 

If you have a fair complexion and you have a budget, you can opt for the erborian one, I only got the 5ml and it’s already pricey for its size lol. But if you want to save money and have a diverse shade options, you can get the missha one. ^^",2,1762143557.0,BB / CC cream / Skin tint recommendation?

nmclpei,1ojhirv,kbeauty,eat6ugs,"i use mostly fungal acne safe products and my skin is pretty dry and sensitive because i'm using a benzoyl peroxide cream.

this is my routine rn, my skin hasn't felt dry since i started on this routine. i've checked the ingredients on folliculitis.


- [TirTir Milk Skin Toner](https://tirtir.global/collections/skincare/products/milk-skin-toner): it makes a huge difference in terms of moisture, the only time my skin looked crusty was when i ran out of it 

- [Hado Labo Lotion Super Hydrator](https://hadalabotokyo.shop/products/hada-labo-tokyo-super-hyaluronic-acid-super-hydrator-lotion-for-age-18-39-150-ml-bottle-pack-of-1): i use this every day AM and PM after the toner/any actives to lock in everything. it 100% helps my skin retain any moisture but it doesn't do much just on its own

- [Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/snail-mucin/products/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence): heard it breaks some people out, hasn't done it to me tho. nice for an extra kick of moisture. it's super gentle, it was one of the only products that didn't make my face feel like it was on fire when i first started using benzoyl peroxide

- [Beauty of Joseph Rice + Probiotics Suncream](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics?_gl=1*fdralv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlCdnlMB0wxQmL_NGNdTKNZwzHPvxRXM59_-EAVczdkyZy9Ap-e8GeIaArrXEALw_wcB&gbraid=0AAAAAp9LuYQ4ifStx8wbrUcbxCuSBza65&variant=43264254476453): it has ONE ingredient that gets flagged by folliculitis scout, but it was hard finding a suncream that was completely FAS (and available in ireland). i did use this [Boots](https://BootsSPF+InvisibleFaceDailySuncareFaceFluidSPF5050mlhttps://www.boots.ie/boots-spfand-invisible-face-daily-suncare-face-fluid-spf50-50ml-10344819) brand one which is FAS, but it would pill so badly and felt so thick. [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/) website has a massive list of FAS products, but i would double check everything on the folliculitis scout ingredient checker


i also tried these two moisturisers before settling on this routine:


- [La Roche Posay Toleraine Sensitive Fluide](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/toleriane-sensitive-fluid-moisturiser/LRP_914.html): it only has 11 ingredients but one layer is barely moisturising, and the price for the amount of product makes it not worth layering

- [Uriage Bariederm-Cica Daily Gel](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/bariederm-cica-daily-gel-cream) it was definitely more moisturising than the la roche posay cream, but it left a weird film on the face that i didn't like",1,1761908428.0,RICH MOISTURIZING PRODUCTS FOR FUNGAL ACNE PRONE SKIN?

- cocoon an giang palmyra palm sugar body polish. i promise you that this will be a different experience than any other body scrub because it not only exfoliates but makes your skin SO soft and dewy after. i’ve tried so many body scrubs and usually think they’re often too drying. only con is if you’re sensitive to smell you might think it’s too strong, but i personally love the smell and after you wash it off there is a very small skin scent trail. the smell to me is like sweet ginger no bitterness at all.

nmbtxmk,1ohn6ub,kbeauty,Aim2bFit,"I have been using Isntree Plum Peptide Booster 2000s for a couple of months, it wasn't too bad at all. Felt the obvious prickly sensation on the first time, thereafter I don't feel them that much because I got used to it  I guess? Idk. Everyone on here seems to be saying how uncomfortable their 1st experiences on VT Reedle 100 with some saying it hurt so much that they didn't continue.

So in my book, VT Cosmetics is the frontrunner of this spicules thing and they are sort of the benchmark to compare all other comapnies' spicules products. Since my first experience was with Isntree, and it was pretty mild, I thought the VT 100 would be a step up for me -- at the point I was thinking maybe the Isntree is only comparable to VT 50 perhaps in terms of sensation.

I just tried my first VT 100 a couple of days ago and I thought THAT was even milder than the Isntree? I hardly felt anything at all. So that was a surprise for me. I also have the 300 sample so I'll try that maybe in several days' time see how it feels.

In terms of effects and benefits on my skin, I can't really tell. My most problematic issue is my melasma. I'm hoping by using spicules, it would help anti tyrosinase inhibitors work much better, but melasma is a tricky thing if it's hormonal as even if the epidermal and dermal layers are being treated, the problem will still persist if systemically the hormones are doing the devil's work non-stop lol",1,1761892165.0,Experiences with Spicules

nllnhi4,1ogz2ai,kbeauty,Unfair_Finger5531,"I wouldn’t use this product. It has far too many allergenic and sensitizing oils in it. The formulation incorporates a lot of citrus oils to give your skin a glow, and the other oils are for fragrance. But all of them are sensitizing, and shouldn’t be used on your face. Bergamot oil in particular is pretty nasty—it can cause contact dermatitis very easily. 

Also, you didn’t show the whole ingredients, so the retinol is not even visible. But it must be very low on the list. Not worth it.

You can get a MUCH better retinol product than this. I think you should toss this one.

nllpzao,1ogz2ai,kbeauty,RadiantStarr,"So looks like this has 0.01% retinAL (a stronger retinoid than retinOL) which is roughly equivalent to 0.1% retinOL. That's a good beginner concentration (0.1% - 0.3% retinOL is what's usually recommended)


With retinoids, you want to make sure you're wearing SPF daily, not just the day after. Start with a small amount once a week (PM only) and slowly increase the frequency as tolerated. With retinoids, frequency and consistency is key. You want to use the highest concentration your skin can handle daily rather than a super high strength one infrequently. Retinoids are best on dry skin after cleansing and before the rest of your routine. But if that's still too irritating for you, you can use it with/after your moisturizer to buffer it until you can tolerate it better


That all said, retinAL is a very unstable ingredient. So without a good formulation, the retinAL will lose strength and won't be effective. And looking at that ingredients list... I really wonder whether it's a stable formula",3,1761542210.0,How to use retinol AB

nlsb26r,1ogz2ai,kbeauty,RadiantStarr,"Botanical extracts and essential oils can be irritating, especially citrus oils (they're even photosensitizing to an extent). Some people have more sensitive skin than others and can't tolerate them at all. Some are fine with them. The presence of botanical extracts isn't a deal breaker imo. But the amount, variety, and types in this particular product is *exceedingly* unnecessary. So much so that it makes me instantly doubt that this product is formulated well and turns me off from the entire brand. It feels like they don't know what they're doing 


I don't have a specific recommendation because I haven't really tried any. My skin is very sensitive to actives. I just cracked open the Iope super bounce serum (0.015% retinOL, super low) and I already have to be careful with it damaging my moisture barrier haha... 


I suggest looking at products from well known brands and produced by a reputable manufacturer (Kolmar, Cosmax, etc). You want a product that comes in opaque, air-tight packaging (no dropper bottles). Also do you due diligence and make sure the products actually have the % of pure retinOL or retinAL that they claim. There are many that actually have a lower percentage but use the total concentration of derivatives on the label to draw in consumers. I've personally landed on Iope after a lot of research and for a multitude of reasons. But there are quite a few Korean retinoids on the market now",2,1761632993.0,How to use retinol AB

nl3zmwc,1oeqz4g,kbeauty,Crazy_Juggernaut9789,"Anyways there is a qr code printed on the little white solid plastic sticker used to  seal the box. 

To verify a JMsolution product, scan the QR code on the packaging using a smartphone camera or a QR code reader app. This will take you to an authorized website where you can check if the product is genuine by looking for details like the product code and a ""genuine"" confirmation on the page. Alternatively, some products also come with a magnet card for a second verification method. 

Steps to verify a JMsolution product using the QR code

Locate the QR code: Find the QR code on the product's packaging.

Scan the code: Use your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app to scan it.

Go to the verification page: The scan will direct you to an official JMsolution verification website.

Confirm authenticity: On the website, check the displayed information to confirm the product is genuine. Look for a red ""genuine"" word, a product code, and a scanned count. 

Alternative verification method (magnet card)

Some JMsolution products include a magnet card.

To use this method, place the magnet card near the upper right corner of the mask's verification area on the packaging.

The verification area should display a green stripe effect, indicating the product is authentic. ",2,1761300442.0,Is this JM Solution mask genuine or counterfeit?

This would not be enough for me in the winter. Since you're asking specifically about winter, I'm going to guess you might have dry skin in the winter? I have a similar issue (but I also have rosacea, which makes my skin barrier challenging).

In my opinion, a good winter skin routine is something like this:

1. Wash

2. First essence (something like Mixsoon Bean Essence or ma:nyo bifida biome toner)

3. A milky toner that's a bit richer (maybe Purito Oat In Silky Toner or Tirtir milk toner)

4. Moisturizer (I really like Skin1004 Enrich Cream)

At night, a thin occlusive on top to keep water from evaporating from your skin overnight. Something like Abib Rice Probiotics Overnight Masks is really good.

The ""first essence"" gives you very gentle exfoliating and skin barrier support. The milky toner gives you a bit more richness. Moisturizer is to add lipids and richer ingredients on top.

nkuvvod,1ocdhli,kbeauty,yearofdjn,"For a quick solution, go to [Anua’s official website](https://anua.com/products/niacinamide-10-txa-4-serum-2), and download or screenshot a picture of the bottle front and back. If they don’t have a picture of the back, the front should be enough. Fake brands have to alter labels, images, and text on the bottle to avoid being sued. Look at your bottle, and zoom in on the screenshots, comparing both. If everything is exactly the same, you have an authentic product. If there are any differences, even as subtle as a dot somewhere that does not appear on the bottle in the screenshot, then it is fake, and you should return it ASAP.

To avoid this in the future, when shopping for skincare on Amazon, look under the “Add the cart”, and “buy now” buttons. You will see some information that includes; ships from, sold by, returns, gift options. Make sure that it is SOLD BY the brand itself, or says something like “Anua official”. Not something crazy like “fjtieaodytnyogisbwyeignri” or “Jane’s Lane”, regardless of the seller’s ratings. Many brands will also have a link on their website that lists verified retailers. If Amazon is not included, I would look elsewhere.

I know it is tempting, especially when there are deals on Amazon you don’t see otherwise, but spending the money on an authentic product is absolutely 110% worth saving yourself from unknown, potentially harmful impurities in fake products. Even if this serum is authentic, I would not risk buying from that store again. The next serum might be fake.

I used to buy VT Cos Reedle Shots from Amazon, I have purchased at least 7 bottles. One of those bottles arrived totally empty, another came broken and would not pump, and a third was fake. That’s when I quit buying skincare from Amazon entirely.

I recommend you try out some discovery kits like this [COSRX](https://www.ulta.com/p/viral-preppair-kit-pimprod2045109?sku=2624299) or [Peach & Lily](https://www.ulta.com/p/glass-skin-discovery-kit-pimprod2014552?sku=2561116) (I just bought this and my skin has been liking it so far).",1,1760758049.0,"32F, dry skin, product recommendations"
nk3fcmw,1o9ksrt,kbeauty,Unfair_Finger5531,"Just quickly: Glass skin can be achieved easily by layering humectants (toners, essences, and serums) heavily and sealing them in with a glossy moisturizer (or non-matte moisturizer). Mists sprayed over the whole thing when you’re done can help even more. The key is layering the humectants first until your skin looks dewy. 

That’s a cosmetic approach to the glass-skin look. But a more holistic and natural approach is to get your skin barrier in tip-top shape. When your barrier is in good shape, your skin will have a natural bounce and elasticity, which will make it look soft and dewy.

For both approaches, it is helpful to add ferments to the list of humectants. Ferments make your skin glow if you layer them. Missha 5x revolution, benton fermentation essence, and mixsoon galactomyces are all glow-makers. The glow will heighten the glass-skin effect, and ferments are generally good for skin conditioning in general. 

I made of list of glowy products a while back, maybe it will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptidesProducts/s/FDr3Yccrtf",1,1760763709.0,"32F, dry skin, product recommendations"
nka310l,1o9ksrt,kbeauty,CatCold7629,"Since your skin leans very dry and gets flaky in winter, I’d start with barrier-focused hydration before layering anything too active. A lot of people jump into K-beauty essences or toners, but what actually helps long term is replenishing the lipid balance. Look for oils or serums that combine squalane, moringa, borage, or marula — these mimic the skin’s natural sebum and deeply hydrate without heaviness.

I formulate small-batch skincare myself, and the biggest mistake I see is skipping nourishment for the barrier. When you give the skin the right fatty acids and antioxidants, it naturally starts to look like “glass skin” because it’s balanced — not because it’s coated in layers. Try introducing one nourishing oil under your moisturizer at night and you’ll probably see smoother texture within a week.",1,1760864908.0,"32F, dry skin, product recommendations"

Many brands make color correctors that will do a great job, but make sure you get a liquid one and not a cream so you can blend it with your foundation. Jung Saem Mool and d'Alba both have green tone up bases, and I know there are several liquid color correctors as well, but I can't remember the brands off the top of my head.

Hello all,

After years of struggling to find the right sunscreen this was my absolute holy grail for the past 4 years or so. I have dry and sensitive skin and my skin reacts really quickly to products that it does not like. Soon Jung's mineral suncream helped my skin stay clear for the years I've been using it. But alas, I realized that this product may no longer be widely sold anymore. I recently tried the Cerave Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30, but my skin did NOT like it. Like, I haven't broken out like this in years. So I've been on the hunt for anything similar to the Soon Jung Directors Mineral Filter Suncream. Any help would be much appreciated 😭

It can also depend on your skin type. If you’ve got oily skin, that can definitely make sunscreens look extra greasy or shiny. 
If you haven’t tried already, go for mineral (physical) sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They usually have a more matte finish compared to chemical ones. I really like the Haruharu Wonder Pure Mineral SPF (purple tube, yellow cap). You can also use a mattifying moisturizer or primer underneath to help keep the shine down.

i liked the aestura derma uv mineral sunscreen, dries down quite matte but since it's mineral it might have a smidge of a white cast (im quite pale so it's a bit harder for me to tell, might need more input on this one). 

there's also a japanese sunscreen that got a bit viral last year called by365 powdery uv cream, it comes in tone up and non tone up. I can attest this one is actually matte, i can't tell if there was any white cast with the non-tone up one but it's pretty cheap when i got it at donki in japan, roughly the price of biore aqua rich

Also in between treatments, you can try azelaic acid and some AHA (not too strong) which helps with fading post inflammatory erythema/hyperpigmentation ie. the red and brown spots left after acne.",4,1762349249.0,Chemical peel (AHA +- BHA) or picolaser as spot treatment?

i would say that typically after your first session, you would expect to see the most drastic results and the subsequent sessions to seem to “slow in improvement” as the first session’s results are usually appear to improve drastically from the original state of the scars!

i would suggest you look into pie/pih combatting skincare to use on your back (if you’re not sensitive to it considering you have a history of eczema) to aid in lightening of the scars. i personally have traces of chicken pox scarring on my lower back and i religiously use skincare and i’ve had very good improvement since! niacinamide is really effective on my skin, alpha arbutin and l-ascorbic acid (most potent and effective form of vitamin c) as well",2,1762349540.0,Chemical peel (AHA +- BHA) or picolaser as spot treatment?

Laka has the strongest tint and it’s the most long lasting!
Entropy doesn’t leave that much of a tint IMO but it feels really nice to apply and it’s very glowy.
Peripera and Fwee are both too sticky for me and I hate the Fwee packaging. I do love Made It though, I have 3 of it just because the colour is so nice and it’s really really pigmented.

nn7g4ga,1oo3c28,AsianBeauty,Advanced-Show-8161,"Have tried almost all of these so here is my take:
Laka - thinner formula, more of a proper lip tint with good staining. color is pretty strong so good for pigmented lips. i have the dark purple shade and it’s definitely cool and looks fairly similar to the swatches, but this might vary for lighter shades. has a strong-ish smell too
Entropy - i like this formula since it’s thicker but the application picks up too much product in my opinion, just makes it a bit messy to apply. also the lid is way heavier than the base so you have to be careful with how you store it. more of a gloss, doesn’t stain
Dinto - definitely agree that the swatches are a bit off, they aren’t as muted as shown. formula is fine, it’s also more of a lip tint formula. does stain, but harder to gauge since my shade is lighter 
Peripera - i have this exact shade and do like the color. it’s a lip gloss rather than tint, and i find it more moisturizing than the others in your list. it’s definitely decently thick/sticky, but you can apply it lighter if you use the back of the applicator rather than the front which has a dip to collect more product

Your sunscreen is your last line of defence in the sun. Don’t bother with stick or spray, get a good old liquid sunscreen and slap a good amount on your face. The best sunscreen is whatever you love enough to use consistently so find a brand that you really really like. I have been using Anessa Perfect Milk for 10+ years. 

- Vitamin C. Use whatever concentration your skin will tolerate, my skin is sensitive and I can’t use anything stronger than the Rohto Melano Premium Essence atm. 

- Skin usually gets dryer as you age so look into deep moisturizing products if you notice your skin drying out. Wrinkles are more obvious on dehydrated skin. I’m currently using the TIRTIR ceramic ampoule and moisturizer.

i don't use any topical collagen, so i figured i'll cut down on trying out new skincare stuff and focus on something that can really make a difference instead. i also always believe that supplements > topical products.

nmy8puw,1onna0o,AsianBeauty,EllenYeager,"I think Ratzilla is just translating what’s included in the Japanese marketing copy so if it’s not mentioned she won’t include it in the table.

Japanese sunscreens tend to value being cosmetically elegant above anything else so they aren’t usually the best for rigorous outdoor sports. The best sports one I’ve tried so far is Biore Athlizm but I just wear it to the gym. I’d still rely on a proper sports oriented one that’s rated for water resistance if I ever want to spend extended amount of time outdoors and will be swimming or sweating a lot.

If I’m wearing makeup and spending some time  outdoors (eg: wedding, hanging out with friends at a cafe patio) I use Anessa. It really works so well under makeup 🥲",6,1762205393.0,Outdoors and Everyday ratings for Japanese sunscreens

Sometimes the reaction is a sign of a compromised barrier. 

Also, it really depends a lot on the products you are using. If you are using products with lots of active and functional ingredients or botanicals or essential oils, the problem could be that. Tiny whiteheads on the cheeks and temples sounds like a reaction to a fragrant ingredient. Butylene glycol is ubiquitous, so you may conclude it is the culprit. But it could very well be something else. Essential oils and fragrances cause tiny whiteheads, and so can epidermal growth factors.

I do like using:
- Mediheal pads
- Haru Haru black rice toner

And I only use Korean or Japanese facial sunscreens. Those are by far the most superior and much cheaper. I'll never give up my Asian sunscreens. 

One of my closest friends used to work in the skincare industry and was actually one of the first beauty bloggers to discover Beauty of Joseon and write about it. We have many discussions about skincare products. I have been given a giant bag of samples of skincare products from another friend and tried many, many brands - Asian and Western. My friends and I have a group chat for skincare and we're constantly sharing information on things we're trying. 

However, being Canadian sometimes the effort to get Korean products is too much of a hassle for the possibility the product breaks me out. It's time consuming to check ingredients and also take a risk on things that won't work.

But the level of nuance displayed in your response exceeds the statement that you “can’t use a lot of Korean products.” The Korean skincare industry is not only massive but also influential and leads the way in skincare innovations, which your “fellow countrymen” benefit from in many ways. You absolutely *could* use a lot of Korean skincare products because a great many differ very little from products from in Canada. But you choose not to do so for certain practical reasons. 

Your nationalistic fervor seems rather tone deaf on a subreddit dedicated to Asian beauty. And because your last paragraph subtly implies that research is a key element in Canadian skincare, I want to underscore that Korean beauty products are also grounded in research and scientific studies, which are often overlooked by western-centric scholars—until they are needed to justify duplicating korean formulations in western nations.

To me, it’s about layering humectants early in the routine, adding ferments, and sealing them in with a moisturizer. My skincare routine sort of builds up to a glow.

I'm planning to start a new skincare routine since what I have now doesn't seem to be working anymore. I have oily skin and live in a hot, humid climate. From what I read in the discussions here, it's best to introduce new products one by one to figure out which one is incompatible and all. 

My first concern is how to go about this new routine. I may be overthinking it but do I continue using the old products minus one that's being replaced with something new first, try it out for 2-4 weeks to see what happens? And repeat the process for every new product? Or do I stop using everything from the old routine and introduce new products in the same timespan but this would end up with me not having much of a routine if I only use 1 new product for every new month.

Lastly, what products should I prioritize changing first? I think the water-based cleanser is the first but not sure what else follows. Asking this because I'd like to buy the absolute essentials first.

nmu755i,1oml9xx,AsianBeauty,fuji-no-hana,"Strictly speaking, this sunscreen is chemical. 

Unfortunately, it contains the UV filter Tinsorb M (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol). 

That UV filter comes in the form of a stark white insoluble powder, so it's just as bad as mineral UV filters on darker skin tones. Some people even consider it to be a ""hybrid filter"" for that reason. 

I'm also black, and I always advise people to look out for the specific problematic ingredients in products you're interested in rather than ask about white cast. Lots of people will just make a judgment call regarding white cast on their own skin, but by knowing the ingredients you can consistently avoid having issues. 

My personal favorite currently is the Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh Sunscreen. Pretty much perfectly fits all of your criteria. I also love the Missha All Around Safe Block Sun Essence SPF 45.

nmhx9ya,1olgza6,AsianBeauty,womensboxers,"I first want to start my review by saying that I feel like some of these blushes were unnecessary/not-worth purchases. Mainly the Dior and Clinique blush. I also listed a decent amount of Western blushes because I have either seen a lot of Korean MUAs/makeup shops carry them, or because I think the shade would be very popular if sold in Korea.

I've seen a lot of complaints about the Dior blush having 0 pigment, but I think it's due to consumers trying to swatch in-store using their finger. It did take a lot of digging in my pan to produce this finger swatch, but a low-density brush picks up the pigment 100x better. That said, I feel like this blush got duped by 10 other brands and there's just way better formulations for a similar pricepoint, like Gucci, Armani, YSL, or Patrick Ta. It's not blurring at all like the other blushes in the list, it's just a wash of color that doesn't do much for my complexion and it's almost too dark for a blue-pink, at least for my liking.

I love the Clinique blush, but it's not worth the pain in the ass it takes to get it shipped from Korea at a markup. The color is super pretty, but damn is it hard to build up any noticeable pigment. It has very subtle pearls in the formula, which the other powder blushes in this post do not. It adds a slight shininess to the cheeks without it looking like glitter. I've been using it for about a year now and hit pan, but also, I've been using it very sparingly because I just really hate having things shipped from overseas. Plus, I feel like the two shades above it (Rom&nd and Dasique) are lowkey dupes for it when applied to the cheeks. Also, while I didn't swatch them today, I have the Melon & Pansy pop shades. If anyone is curious, I will answer in a further comment but this review is already long enough on it's own.

I have conflicting thoughts about both of the Rom&nd blushes. The ""deeper"" one (it's not deep at all), Blueberry Chip, is the perfect daily shade for me--it's a perfect mute/neutral pink that doesn't look like skin irritation--and I don't need to use much of it. I see a lot of Korean MUAs/YouTubers use the Strawberry one as a ""blush base"" and while I do notice a slight improvement in blending and saturation when doing that, the blush is SO POWDERY that it's just annoying to use. It flies everywhere. And while it blends very smoothly, I hate the fallout and mess it makes in the pan if you're rushing in the mornings like I am. If I had to describe the texture of this blush, it'd be like flour or powdered sugar--very fluffy.

The Dasique blushes feel like ""watered down"" versions of the Rom&nd blushes. Less pigmentation, but also less fallout. It feels more chalky than it does powdery. I need to build it up a lot with the brush. But I do find myself reaching for the coral shade a lot as it's very fluorescent and makes my blush stand out (without looking garish/clown-y). It's a good product for the price, and as a very pale person I'm not concerned with the lack of pigment that those with deeper skin tones might find an issue with.

Finally, the Patrick Ta blushes have to be my current favorite. No fallout and very buildable. I am yet to try the ""cream-over-powder"" technique that Patrick Ta recommends because that has not consistently worked for my other cream blushes including Dior and Armani; it's a hit-or-miss technique. I noticed for the ""She's That Girl"" shade, however, the cream is very obviously cool-leaning while the powder is extremely warm so I kinda feel like I threw half of my money away--but I like the formulation and color of the cream so much that I'm fine with that. It also reminds me of AOU's blush in the Peony shade, but that's just me imagining things--if someone has it, feel free to comment a picture of it lol. I like the ""Just Enough"" duo for super cool-toned makeup looks, where I might even pop on a little bit of my purple Clinique blush.

But it's more neutral or spring.

For cool tone, I recommend heather or pink pop as I've swatched them in store before. Pansy pop is PURPLE-PURPLE. I see most Korean MUAs/influencers using it like a ""blush topper"" to shift the tone of any blush they already applied, or very lightly and sheered out to create a wash of super cool-toned pink.

nmlu86f,1olye7f,AsianBeauty,Spirited_Cupcake3744,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have **light medium, warm leaning olive skin**, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

https://preview.redd.it/xkd6qzilvpyf1.jpeg?width=3972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=113842cc80be66f72248c41df367b561cb0f29d9

Here’s **my experience with the blush shades** I have:

1. Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2. Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3. Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4. Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too *ashy*, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5. Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

**Some lip shades I have:**

* Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1. Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2. Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3. Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4. Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5. Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.

Anyway, my **ideal** lip color is one that’s as close to my **natural lip color** as possible and lines up the best with my **skin tone**. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (**peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink**).

The main struggle I’m having is **finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.**

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing **matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product** that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too! Thanks :) 🙏",2,1762035437.0,"Anything Goes Saturday: November 01, 2025"

I’ve been using the Curel powder in balm intensive moisture care tube religiously ever since my stress-induced hormonal imbalance flare ups, which caused my face to suddenly become the richest oil well ever that even the Saudi Arabians would be jealous of. 😂 I also was diagnosed with Type 2 rosacea, and breakouts aside my face would ITCH whenever anything came into contact with it. Hence this balm — god it was a holy grail.

So I’ve been using the same tube for 4-5 months, and I have a very peculiar habit of trying to squeeze everything out beyond its lifetime because a “dime is a dime”, and towards the end the balm has become so powdery, crumbly, and hard to spread out.

nmlptag,1olanj4,AsianBeauty,AdultTeenGirl,"I think I have an issue with this or butylene glycol. And not always. Just have often experienced products with these ingredients not fully drying/leaving this film feeling and then my face eventually gets irritated from too much dampness so I don’t know that it’s necessarily an allergy/sensitivity or the mechanism. Because I’ve had the same experience mixing too much glycerin in my moisturizer before too, then slugging over it with oil. And I’m fine with all of that in reasonable amounts. The over hydration irritation I get is this redness, itchiness, and tiny pustules that do not look like acne. And it always takes a few days of subjecting it to the glazed donut treatment before it starts creeping up, first with the mildest itch. 

Have had this with Korean sunscreens and also ampoules/serums (wrote about it happening with Iunik beta glucan elsewhere in this thread). No problems with my beloved Zeroid moisturizers though 1,2-hexanediol is not as high in the ingredients there. Maybe it’s also about how one usually uses less moisturizer vs other skincare products.

nn5t9a7,1okuz55,AsianBeauty,the_sweetest_peach,"Hiya!  Happy to share, friendo!

I like the Naturie Hatomugi products a lot!  I have the Skin Conditioner and the Skin Conditioning Gel.  I’ve never tried the Skin Conditioning Milk, but I hear it’s like an emulsion in consistency if you need extra moisture!

I also really like Hada Labo!  I have the Shirojyun Premium Lotion (blue bottle) for brightening, and the Gokujyun Premium Lotion (gold bottle) for added moisture, but the gold one also helps with brightening because it has seven types of hyaluronic acid inside, and hyaluronic acid has wound healing properties.  Plus I have the Hada Labo Perfect Gel!  I will say the Gokujyun Premium Lotion and the Perfect Gel can seem sticky when you apply them—the trick is to work them into your skin past the “this feels sticky” phase.  You may need to clean your hands off and then pat the products in some more to ensure they get absorbed properly!

The first time I used each of these Japanese products after the Korean products I’d tried previously had left me looking too shiny—especially the moisturizers—I was like “Oh yeah.  MUCH better.”

I hope some (or all) of these will work for you!

I will say I do still love Korean sheet masks for the extra moisture boost!  Torriden Dive In sheet masks and Round Lab Dokdo sheet masks are the best!",1,1762305914.0,Some of my recent hauls ~

nmo3uwk,1oksk0u,AsianBeauty,AppropriateBeing9885,"I literally just had a bad experience with them, too! I was wondering if anyone's experience had changed recently! I was only on my second order with them. 

My situation: items that said they'd be with them in 7-14 days weren't there after 14 days. I then had to contact them to discuss it even though not getting something within an advertised timeframe is obviously an issue on the sellers end. They then said I could keep waiting (but that they had no idea when they'd get those products) or refund the non-supplied items and ship the rest. I left extra days, just to see if they'd end up eventually getting the things. They didn't, and I then sent an email on October 29, asking whether, instead of what they suggested, I could just substitute/add other products I wanted that cost more, obviously at my additional cost. Given what a saga it was turning out to be, when they didn't reply promptly to the email, I ended up contacting them again through the chat feature to get that clarification, feeling like enough time had already been wasted (the answer was no!) I then opted that day to just have the rest shipped. They then sat on the order for several days after that, which I thought was kind of wild after everything else! Ultimately, I put in the order on October 11 and it was only shipped yesterday.

I didn't really have issues with the other order I made before this, but couldn't believe how convoluted this became. Because it took so long, I ended up having to locally buy another serum and lotion at our wack Australian prices because I'd been waiting so long for the stuff in the order to get to me that I was running low on what I use, and genuinely had no idea when I'd ever see the Yesstyle products because of how annoying this whole timeline was. I also so agree about the annoyance of getting their marketing emails while going ""Yeah, okay...but where's the stuff I already ordered, damn it?!"" I also think it's not good policy for unsupplied product refunds to be automatically given as store credit and only provided as a genuine refund if a customer takes an extra step, when this is specifically happening in the context of a business not supplying items it said it could. Like, I didn't change my mind about the products. The shop changed its ability to supply items. Why do customers then need to opt-in to a bona fide refund that potentially takes 30 days? 

I know it's skin products and I don't have some emergency need for them, but some of this just isn't good business practice and I don't feel like it's that hard to realise that this would be annoying to customers. Maybe the business just has so much money and so many customers that they don't really care about bothering some, though - especially due to how competitive their prices are and how massive the range is.",2,1762068687.0,Never ordering from Yesstyle again

This glides on like butter and is so soft and smooth. This, however, is not water and sweat resistant so you might wanna reapply but other than that the texture is like whipped cream. One thing that I've noticed is that it also calms down the skin because the ingredients are barrier repairing as well. Redness calms down. For me, it definitely sinks in, very hydrating and moisturizimg, plus it gives that radiance and luminosity that is just chef's kiss. Reapplication is smooth too. It has no fragrance.

So I've had Japanese Hair Straightening 4 or 5 times now and I'm kind of annoyed with my results this time 😭 I did my maintenance the same as usual, washed for the first time after about 80 hours and from the first time I dried it I noticed it felt off. I have pretty stubborn curls, so I suspect the solution wasn't left in long enough or something as my roots are still curly and the length is still rather frizzy. I'm wondering if anyone on here has an idea if this is most likely just damage and I'll just need to grow it out, or if this is something a second session will fix.

Hi! So i have acne prone skin (or had?? As i was on accutane and the acne completely went away, didnt have a single breakout since then) but i had some bumps which felt like just congestion deep inside my skin. I never used anything special for my skincare, just salicylic acid facewash and moisturizer + spf. My skin is on the drier+dehydrated side but my nose can get oily. It has been 2 years since i got done with accutane.

So i started using this serum around 3 weeks ago (nights) along with the centella tone brightening ampule (morning). My moisturizer & facewash are the same.  I started getting smallll breakouts (some are pus filled, some become whiteheads) around my mouth (the congestion usually was around my mouth. if i sort of stretched the skin u could see it, but in the daylight) since a couple of days ago. 

Could this be purging? Im kind of terrified because i had acne most of my life and accutane saved me. Im so scared of having it again ... i hope this IS purging and not acne making a comeback... i dont think there was this much congestion around my mouth??",1,1762044272.0,"HAVE A QUESTION? ASK HERE!

Skin Type: Normally combo/normal but drier recently due to tretinoin use 

Country/Climate: UK Cold and Dry

Top Skin Concern: Patches of texture on my right cheek, faint fine line on forehead

Current Routine/Products I am Using:
Actives: Tretinoin Cream, Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads (contain PHA/LHA)
Hydrating/Soothing: Centella Hydrating Mist Spray, Centella Hyaluronic Acid
Barrier Support: Laneige Water Bank Moisturiser, Purito Barrier Cream

AM Routine: (The routine I'm currently following)
1.  Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads 
2.  Laneige Vitamin C 
3.  Centella Hyaluronic Acid
4.  Centella Hydrating Mist Spray
5.  Laneige Moisturiser 
6.  BOJ Sunscreen

PM Routine: (I am alternating actives with rest days to avoid irritation)

Tretinoin Nights (Mon/Fri): Cleanse > Tretinoin > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Glycolic Nights (Wed): Cleanse > Numbuzin Pads > Glycolic Acid > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Rest/Repair Nights: Cleanse > Centella Mist > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream 


I'm looking for feedback on whether the alternating PM routine is safe and effective for treating the texture while managing the dryness. I also am suspicious that the Purito cream may be making my face sting a little but am not sure if it’s due to the cream or overdoing my actives. The stinging only started 4/5 weeks into using tretinoin around the time I got the Purito cream.

nmclxoa,1ok2qlh,AsianBeauty,Southern-Scar6916,"Sorry babes I don't have time to go full on into this and pull out my whole collection. It's vast.

The issue with most tints is they're actually brighter than this shade (which I love) e.g. things like lilybryred Blackberry Tequila or 3CE ""Spiced Up"" in Lazy Pop Stain. I have a million plum vamps, and 332 K-Tints but we're not on speaking terms atm (Bright. Bright little girl colours I just can't).

Girlcult J808 and Dinto 216 ""Umbra"" are pretty much bang on to the Uhue U05 Like amazing close. Dinto you will need to layer to get the pigment.

Uhue MIrror Lipstick in G625. That's a more purple vamp than brown red, but it's a gorgeous vamp and it's still got that shine and sheerness if you want the comfort and a bit more ""soft goth""

Uhue Gloss in U06 is a similar tone, it's just much more sheer, a bit lighter and a bit less vamp and has glitter in it. That is actually still available through ""LookHealthyStore"". I've bought through them (Chinese) b4. Hyntoor's OG old Whimsical Planet Watery Lip Gloss in 002. Probably skip it tho, too sheer. Couldn't find it.

""Romantic Goth""? I'm old and goth goth, but I'm trying to think outside the box:

Pinate Bare Glow Peptide Melting Balm in ""Sequence"". It's similar to Uhue U06 it's sort of sheer plummy but with gorgeous glitter. It's ""classy sheer vamp"".  
Into You Glowing Lipstick in ML07 (Mauve) -  this is so classy and muted purple. It's romantic. I love it.  
Derol (YesStyle) Sugar Candy Glossy Balm ""Dominant"" is a deep vamp burgundy, Messy and all other shades are not nice but it's so cheap.  
Shellwe Makeup x Freya86 Punk Bunny Collection Gloss. It is beautiful. didn't swatch 'cos I knew it was a deep cool-tone but check it out. It's a lovely vamp and could be worn more sheer, too.  
Fenty Gloss Stix in ""Black'r Berry - she deep vamp tho, but you could sheer it out.  
Girlcult obvs. Sheered out, J809 and J816 might work in Lip Glaze, they're pretty deep though FYI, L06 Nightfeast (sheered out also) could look sort of ""classy goth"", but again that's a very deep brownish vamp like the others, I think the Mirror Glaze J7X's might be too gothy. J808 is a huge contender tho, just remember it tastes like roses.  
Rom&nd Deep Sangria JLT if you can still get it. It's not this but it's vampy/soft goth. Plum Coke if you don't mind a bit brighter. The black tint is back in the mini TJLT now (some of the mini Glasting Glosses are fun colours/colour changers)  
Heart Percent Dote On Mood Top Coating Lip Plumper in Mood Changer is a deep plum, so cool-toned, but could be handy to just mute and vamp down some of your existing collection.  
Don't overlook Revlon or L'Oreal on this.

More Goth Goth:

Hyntoor released some new shades recently, including a more trad red in their lip mud (B02 ""Carrie"") but not so close to this, it's more of a cool-tone or neutral-red, plus a black mirror gloss squeeeeeeee). Also look at their Dark Style Reverse Macaroon Lip Muds and the Subversive Series in their lip muds.  
Kaleidos lip muds, not shine, but they have several gorgeous brown red shades e.g. Cognac and Bloodstone, check out their other vamp reds like Rubino or Smeared Rouge, they're cooler-toned tho  
DRAMO Moonlight in the Bottle Lip Mud Series  
CARMELA Renaissance and Waste Soil Collection Lip Mud Series  
Girl's Crush (Red Thorn and Black Rivet are lovely)  
Parper Lab have some rad lip muds/liquid lips (black, white, vamp)  
Other than that it's Western indie for me so I'll leave it there.",36,1761908539.0,looking for lip tints w this color or any other romantic goth lippie recs are welcome!

nmkw5yf,1ok2qlh,AsianBeauty,Southern-Scar6916,"Hiya. Me again (sorry mods I didn't realise I couldn't give other Western recs in one post).

So, I've just been thinking today that you might be after that picture's colour (which is stunning) and not what the actual Uhue gloss looks like IRL, it does tend to come off deeper which is why Gircult J808 and Dinto 261 Umbra (I think I kept reversing my numbers on that) are decent matches. You could sheer it right out I guess but to get that nice shine I need to pile it on. 

So, I can't give you my Western rec I found but I was making room for my new Rom&nd releases and I thought I'd just show you these two from Rom&nd (3 technically but that was a play around). If you want a deeper vamp or brickish red, then Zero Velvets got you covered, but I think these, especially the gloss might be a vibe for you.

https://preview.redd.it/05c831gg2pyf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61484b785101763873ec84e7b08f12442e26b3bc

Rom&nd Glasting Gloss 18 Red Bean Sirutteok. It's a mini, it's not on YS or OY yet, it's on Beauty Box Korea and a few eBay sellers I use sometimes so that's a pain but it's gorge. You need to layer to get anything like Uhue pigment (and I think you'll still fall short) and it's a bit of a different finish, but I just feel like it's such an elegant soft of ""soft"" classy vamp-lite. Bit of red, bit of plum, bit of brown.

The second is good old Rom&nd Glasting Water Tint in 17 Woody Sunset. I feel like this is going to be a little too bright overall, though depends on your lip pigment, maybe a bit too like, brown as well...but I also wonder what mixing in some of the other reds would do. 

I swatched Milk Tea Velvet Tint 2 in ""Black Tea"" sheered right out (that's quite browny plum, but sheers out to more of a vamp plum, not on par with what you're after but it's pretty and I was just playing. Earl Grey nice too). The others at the back too bright.

As far as I know YesStyle prices include the VAT. I placed an order and it was below £135 so didn’t qualify for customs. But It states on YesStyle’s website that if we get charged fees they will reimburse us with credit.

Yes. An import duty of *up to* 25%. There is the chance there could be a higher fee imposed on orders over 135 gbp to bring it in line.

Prices won't necessarily go up at point of sale, you'll just have to account for paying DLD/Royal Mail before it can be delivered.

Specifically designed for extreme climate conditions. Engineered to withstand high temperatures (40°C) and humidity (75%), this advanced sunscreen ensures long-lasting, durable protection against intense sun exposure.

Powered by Exclusive Tough Boost Technology, it provides friction resistance, maintaining its protective layer even with sweat, wiping, and clothing contact. Its very water-resistant formula offers up to 80 minutes of protection, making it ideal for outdoor activities.

Enriched with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, butylene glycol, and eucalyptus extract, it helps maintain skin moisture, preventing dryness caused by prolonged sun exposure. Additionally, it is non-comedogenic and dermatologically tested, making it suitable for daily wear.

D program by Shiseido is my favorite skincare brand and it’s worked wonders for my skin. It’s mainly formulated for sensitive skin so there are no fragrances :)",51,1761807155.0,Luxury brands/products: are they worth it?
nm5wa82,1ojs9lz,AsianBeauty,heids1234,"Certain products are worth it, to me, but I am an older woman (46) with a good amount of disposable income. I don't really have to budget/save up for skincare so I've tried a few mid to higher end products, both western and Asian brands.

Cons are they are usually fragranced, pros are more elegant formulations, advanced delivery systems and higher amounts of beneficial ingredients meaning they feel good on my skin, absorb better and deliver what they need to in a way that makes a difference to me.

Note that my routine isn't exclusively ""luxe"", I use them with more reasonably priced products. And just because they are luxe doesn't mean they would work better for everyone - case in point my favourite cleansing balm remains the BoJ cleansing balm. I prefer it to all others I have tried including Elemis (which was waxy and left a residue - ugh).

AB mid to luxury products that are staples in my routine:
- Sulwhasoo FCAS - for the glow. Works best paired with another first essence, used to be SK-II but I'm trying it out with Missha FTE to see if it works just as well.
- Sulwhasoo Ginseng cream, both classic and rich. My skin loves ginseng and this packs a punch - softening, smoothing, firming. I gave a sample of this to my 71 year old mum who was never into skincare and she now loves it as much as I do, I buy her a couple of tubs a year.
- SK-II cleansing oil - this alongside Fancl is my favourite. Skin feels so soft afterwards.
- su:m37 micro active powder wash - I use this a few times a week, particularly after makeup. Wonderful cleanser and I think a little bit exfoliating (which is why I can't use it too frequently)
- Whoo Bichup - great serum, skin softening and smoothing. I use this at night as it's too rich for my morning routine
- Sooryehan The Black Serum - same effects as Bichup but lighter consistency. The first time I used it I couldn't stop touching my face, it felt lovely and smooth.
- Amorepacific Vintage Single Extract Essence - a wonderful first essence. This one is in my evening routine, gives me a dose of antioxidants and also has a smoothing effect.",47,1761817357.0,Luxury brands/products: are they worth it?

I *do* think that online discussions of Asian beauty focus too heavily on drugstore products, such as Hada Labo, Canmake, etc.,--this isn't a problem per se (it's great if those products work for you, especially in this economy), but it's like limiting yourself to brands like NYX and Wet n Wild in non-AB. Unfortunately, a lot of midrange/luxury AB products are not very accessible overseas, which means a lot of people don't discuss them because they are simply not aware of them.

  
Personally, I don't use Korean luxury brands because I don't vibe with their traditional aesthetics (my mum and grandma love them, though...), but I love Japanese department store brands. They have more interesting but still very wearable and stylish shades compared to drugstore brands when it comes to makeup products, plus some great foundations and primers. I also enjoy luxury skincare but do note that a lot (most?) of them contain fragrance. Some of my favorite brands are: Shu Uemura (their legendary cleansing oil), IPSA (toners), Cosme Decorte (sunscreen, liposome skincare line), Celvoke (their makeup line in general, cleansing oil, facial oil), Addiction Tokyo (makeup), THREE (makeup). I also recently got deluxe samples of Pola/BA's toners and cream, which are amazing. The weather's getting dry where I live, and they hydrate my skin perfectly.

nm6uy72,1ojs9lz,AsianBeauty,idratherbeinside,"Luxury skincare definitely isn't necessary because there are so many affordable brands, however there are some items that I think are worth the money.

As i've moved into my 30s i've started exploring luxury skincare and there are hits and misses of course. Lux products are usually formulated for an older demographic which has both its pros and cons. (Pros: cosmetic elegance, packaging, lots of R&D around products/ingredients, they don't discontinue products easily. Cons: heavily fragraced, products are heavier and can be worse for acne prone skin, don't follow skincare trends as closely)

I think if you have the disposable income, its fun to try some luxury products. I would recommend getting sample packs before buying anything full size, and also wait for sales. Sales on lux products can be a bit more rare, but i never pay full price for lux products!

nma9kqf,1ojs9lz,AsianBeauty,cat_grrrl,"Short answer is no. I don't think you need to buy ultra luxury to achieve the best skin you can have. I think a moderately priced lines are usually most cost effective. The increase in the benefit is not directly proportional with the increase in price. 

My take is buy what works for you and save the $$$ for cosmetic procedures. 

Long answer is it depends. 

If you are 30 something with decent skin, $575 Cle de Peau La Creme is not going to give you 10 times visible result than $40 Aestura cream. Your skin might look a little plumper, glowier but it's not going to be night and day. 

I have no problem buying expensive foundation if it gives me the coverage and finish I want. In my experience, the luxury brand tends to have foundation with better textures, less clogging, more color range and better packaging. As for  point makeup, I don't think my make up look that much different using $20 pallette vs $100+ pallette. 

For skincare, the uber expensive ones are lovely, feel more luxurious and smell a lot better, but they still don't erase fine lines or discoloration for me. 

Some expensive one, like SKII essence, gave me breakout.

Then I got their blue one shortly before their reformation. Tried both formulations for the blue one. I’m not a fan on how it sits under my foundation (Shu Uemura) so I just use concealer to cover my bags.

Compared to Anessa or Biore water gel grip and Suncut. I felt it’s way better as it doesn’t make my makeup look patchy/peeling like a lizards 


Shu Uemura (advanced) unlimited foundation

For context I live in a climate that’s hot and humid and I have combination skin (though it’s not as oily as when I was a teen)

I need a foundation that can last in a hot and humid climate.

I bought my first bottle in 2023 after getting swatched and asked for a sample to take home and tried it out. My then best friend said it looked very good after a long day of wearing it, so I got it after I considered my preferred options. The bottle lasted me over a year of wearing it

Got my second bottle in 2024 from cosme in Tokyo. Then they had the tsuya version of it and was contemplating getting it. Still stuck to the OG

Got my third bottle last week at their store in Daimaru, Sapporo (colder climate) after the reformulation (advanced). Had the same dilemma picking the matte one or the Tsuya one asked my sis to help me decide which looks better after getting swatched by the MUA. 

Stuck with the matte one considering I’m from a hot country

I haven’t tried it yet as I haven’t finished using my second bottle


Shu Uemura cleaning oil
Ngl one of the best cleansing oil. I’ve used 3 variations so far. The green, ultim8, black

Got my first full sized anti pollution (green) (450ml) at steal during warehouse sale where it’s like $150 usual price but I got it at $96. The bottle lasted me a year and a half.

I got ultim8 as a travel sized sample, works pretty good as well, makes my skin legit feel moisturized.

Currently I’m using the black one (pores), I say it’s alright just the texture of the oil is watery compared to the green and ultim8. No decrease in QOL so far

RMK first sense hydrating lotion is an excellent lightweight hydrating lotion to use right after cleansing and before serum. RMK isn’t as expensive as other upscale Japanese brands but their skincare is great. I have used their hydrating oil and advance cream, which are great for dry skin. 

Sulwhasoo ginseng cream is fabulous. Just a tiny amount needed to keep the skin well moisturized.

nm4zd5v,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,Legally_Blonde_258,"Even dermatologists (or at least the ones I follow) say that the minimal skincare routine is just a starting point and that you should add additional products if necessary to meet your skin's needs. So for me, thats where I start. My skin needed tret for acne. Which meant that it needed way more hydration bc of the tret. So I had to add products to address that. Finally found the balance and now my skin is happy and so am I.

In terms of choosing products, I look for those that are intended to meet the need that I have. Sometimes it's based on a long track record of proven results (tret for acne). Other resources include recommendations from people who have similar skin type/needs, understanding what ingredients are likely to be beneficial or harmful to my skin in particular based on past experience, expert advice on specific products that are good for people with my needs (e.g. lists of good moisturizers for people on tret).

Also, lotion is not optional when you use retinoids. And it definitely isn’t when you use retinoids AND vitamin c daily. One thing about a “minimalist” routine is that it can actually be harmful to the barrier when you remove basic products. The scaling back needs to be thoughtful and reasonable. It isn’t just removing items; it’s also about knowing what to keep. Anything that supports your barrier and hydration should be in the routine. Whether you need niacinamide and Aza—only you know that.

I personally have a “base routine.” It is products that I use every single day, no matter what. From there, I bring in actives as I need them based on what I’m trying to achieve.

2) what skin concern(s) are you trying to address

3) look into products that help that skin concern. Read online reviews, compare reviews on YouTube, reddit the official site etc. to gauge. If people had issues with the product see why, and what issues caused.

4) pop all the items you are interested in your cart, and asses them together as a whole routine or addition to your current routine and with your budget. The goal to to not have too many repetitive products, as too many products can also cause a negative effect. Also question whether this is smth you really need or are getting cause it's hyped up online and you've seen ""amazing"" effects. Chances are if your skin is already doing well you don't need to add anything.

5) let the thought marinate before buying

6) be consistent with using it once you get it, your not gonna see immediate results",3,1761850164.0,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?
nm5563r,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,EllenYeager,"I have adhd and low executive function so here’s my absolute bare minimum when I can’t keep up with life. my main focus is hydration. I use an oil cleanser and gel cleanser at the end of the day. 

AM: toner pad, sunscreen.

PM: reedle shot 100, tirtir milk toner (has niacinamide), tirtir ceramic ampoule (is pretty heavy so I usually skip moisturiser) - this is the combo I rely on the most. 

OR

PM: reedle shot, toner, whatever sheet mask

OR

PM: cosrx abc toner, melano cc premium essence (vitamin c), moisturiser - my skin is really sensitive so I’m gradually building resistance to eventually use stronger AHA/BHA and vitamin c.

I have other products like retinol and azelaic acid (trying this out for my rosacea) that I do use on good days. but when the days are bad I just stick to my bare minimum.",3,1761801105.0,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?

From there, I add actives based on what I want to focus on. For example, about three months ago I added azelaic acid in the morning because I've heard good things and I haven't tried it before, despite having redness. Because my base is solid, when I introduce a new product I can relatively quickly see if it works for me or not; azelaic acid did.

- 1: my morning routine needs to be simple. If i use anything between a water cleanse (or rarely a micellar water) and my sinscreen, it needs to be frickin effective. In my case, it's mostly zinc PCA, bakuchiol and/or one of those stabile vitCs, cos i know those work. Maybe a random face mist to combat heat throughout the day.
- 2: no using actives on retinol night. So i don't use retinol every time, more like every other night, and the other fun things can go in between. (On that note: mists/toners can be fun.

nm57gnw,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,qualified_to_be,"How I determine what actives I’m choosing for a more streamlined routine has multiple factors:

A. Does this address more than one of *my* skin issues?

B. Have I used this active (or product) and found positive results? Or have I had better results in other actives or products?

C. Does it have long term benefits or been researched on? What does the medical literature suggest? Is it a fad?

My routine has both Asian skincare and American skincare so I won’t list out the exact products in my routine. I allotted one ‘additional’ product that wasn’t part of the core set that you listed (cleanse, moisturize, sun protection, retinoid). Has to be a good product that you’ve gotten amazing results with it, wouldn’t want to go without kind of thing.

AM: no cleanse, just sunscreen before I do makeup
PM: double cleanse, toner (this is my chosen additional product), alternate Azelaic Acid and Retinoid, and moisturize!

nm5391o,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,SweetDorayaki,"I found the top-down approach to be easier for myself (otherwise I'd be way more lost and overwhelmed by all the available stuff on the market):

- Identify main skin concerns and know your skin type
- Rank in order of importance/largest impact 
- research clinically backed ingredients that address the top 1-2 concerns. Often, ingredients may have multiple benefits, and sometimes ingredients have different chemical forms, differing pros/cons (e.g. faster results but also increased risk of irritation), and sometimes have concentrations that are more effective vs more gentle. Pick one or two ingredients that address the top concern(s).
- Set a budget for how much you want to spend, then research the products that have your key ingredient at a clinically effective concentration. Narrow down to 3 max to consider.
- To decide between products, I compare online reviews (I find 3-4 star reviews to be more reliable), see if anyone on reddit with similar skin type and issues have shared their experience with the product, and see if any dermatologists online have reviewed the product. All sponsored reviews are taken with a large grain of salt, I generally don't trust/look for input from influencers either, but in this day and age we are all susceptible lol.
- Price and ease of purchase/receipt of product also is considered. I often add items to the cart and let it sit for at least a day, if not a week. That way I can be more confident it's not an impulse buy bc I was influenced into it.
- After receiving it, know that consistency is key when applying products. Also, introduce new products slowly (especially if the ingredients are known to be irritating), then increase the frequency I use it",11,1761800096.0,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?

So, I have been using my Apagard Premio from Amazon and I watched a video that mentioned that if I use Nano Hydroxypatite, after washing my teeth I should get a gritty feeling on my teeth from the Hydroxypatite crystalization, so I started to have doubts on my tooth paste as I never get a gritty sensation afterwards on my teeth, then I got from Google's ai that the paste itself should be soft and it shouldn't have a gritty, sandy texture like other toothpastes, can someone confirm if that's true? The one I bought has indeed a sandy texture when I bite into it, the box is very pretty but now I am unsure, help!  
I need to know multiple things:

1. Have I wasted money TT . TT
2. Have I wasted time with a bad paste XC
