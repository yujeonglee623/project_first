긍정,"I love the 345 cream, I’m about to order my 3rd tube. I have the axis-y serum too, but I would say I tend to reach for the 345 much more. Better results for me reducing redness and acne scarring.",6
중립,"I’ve been using the Axis-Y serum for two months now, but I haven’t noticed much of a difference.",4
중립,The 345 cream broke me. How many of you had the same experience.,2
중립,I feel like the axis-y did absolutely nothing for me at all,2
긍정,"I have the BoJ eye cream. Chatgpt said it's not a miracle cream, but it's good if you just want something light for your eye. Not for dark under eye or something",3
중립,I’m trying to use up my BOJ eye cream. I’m not a fan as it’s not moisturizing enough.,1
중립,How do you apply it on your face? Do you use it in spots or just put it all over,2
긍정,Thank you!!,1
중립,I’ve not experienced that myself. Are you sensitive to niacinamide? I just realized yesterday that it lists that as an ingredient.,1
중립,Can you advice any other cream you try to avoid the first wrinkles?,1
중립,"All over! I will put the cream on, let it sink in and put my moisturizer on top.",1
중립,What wrinkles? Where?,2
중립,"around the eyes, forehead and smile lines",1
긍정,I'm trying to focus my skincare routine on making pores less visible and being less red. It does not focus on wrinkles. So I don't know which products are good for that.,1
중립,"It's possible that your T-zone is dehydrated. You could try layering more of the essence to minimize the flakiness. 

Personally when I had a lot of flakiness with my makeup I found it was due to a damaged skin barrier as well",3
중립,Following,1
중립,"How are you cleansing your skin? If you used to have oily skin but now it feels dry, there's a high chance that your cleansing routine might be the issue",1
중립,You can try a thicker moisturizer like a facial cream rather than a lotion and putting it on overnight. That should help with dry skin too. I also have dry skin.,1
중립,"I haven’t changed anything at all, it happened within the past 6 months and i’ve had the same cleansing balm and cetaphil moisturizer. I live in socal so it’s moderate temp. i’m thinking it might be aging lol",1
중립,"i’ll dry! I had to switch from gel moisturizer to a thicker one, I guess I just have to keep getting thicker",1
긍정,"When your skin is shedding flakes like that, it’s actually important to focus on moisturizing with a good hydrating cream. Using exfoliating products to remove the flakes can lead to sensitive skin. If your skin is dry, the best thing you can do is hydrate frequently. A dermatologist once told me this. Personally, I switched to Bioderma Essence Lotion for my skincare routine and saw great results, so I think it will improve your dry skin texture as well. But make sure to judge what’s best for your skin!",1
중립,Did you get a straightener treatment in the past? Keratin etc?,5
중립,My hair used to look like that and sometimes still does ngl but using leave in conditioner after getting out of the shower helps,3
중립,"My hair looks very similar, I don't know what to do with it 😞",2
긍정,I have very similar hair. Kundal honey and macadamia shampoo + treatment are amazing in my experience!,1
중립,"yeah i got that treatment like 3 years ago, it completely grew out tho, i cut my hair many times! i think its the weight of my hair that makes it straight at the bottom but idk how to fix this apart from cutting my hair",1
중립,do you apply the conditioner near the roots? because that’s where i get the most frizz,1
중립,i use the same treatment! how long do u leave it for?,1
긍정,"It does look like the very ends of what were your roots when you first did the treatment. If you are not willing to chop it off I would recommend you get a semi permanent perm. Ask them to mimic your wave pattern from roots to ends. Semi permanent perm lasts from 3 to 6 months depending on hair. DONT do a permanent one or you will have the same problem but reverse in a couple years.

Good luck!",1
중립,I apply it everywhere tbh - they say if you apply near the roots you have to wash your hair more bc it’ll get oilier faster but I haven’t seen that.,1
중립,"Definitely over 5 minutes, and I do put it on top of my head as well. Not rubbing into the scalp ofc, but still making sure it’s all over my hair, since I do get the most frizz on top",1

중립,I've been using the ETUDE Lash Serum and I looove it!,3
긍정,"If your skin feels dry, it’s best to spray some toner on your face and apply plenty of cream. If you prefer using an all-in-one product, I recommend the mary&may blackberry complex essence!It has a toner-like texture but feels moisturizing even on its own. However, since you mentioned your skin is dry, I think applying a hydrating cream would be a better option.",1
중립,Mix your moisturizer with aquaphor and use it consistently.,1
중립,"Use more humectants. If what you are using isn’t working, you need more. And it’s humectants that you need. Add one or two toners to the routine.",1

긍정,"I have so many mists. Skin1004 hyula-Cica mist is really nice, aestura mist is the most hydrating, and pky mist is soothing and hydrating. Also manyo bifida mist is pretty intense and gives a nice glow.",6

중립,"I make my own, distilled water, glycerine and rosewater. Beautiful. Works well. ",4
긍정,"I love using the etude house soonjung 5.5 relief toner decanted into a mist spray. For something a bit more moisturizing for the winter but isn't as heavy/creamy as cream mists, I got the dr keuracle kombucha tea mist version. It's definitely not an good as the essence and it's fragranced. I plan on just decanting the regular essence into it after I finish it up",3

중립,Very smart,1

중립,Is the photo of the American version? I buy this from olive young but the packaging looks different? I recently ordered and had no problems.,1
중립,The photo is definitely a/ the American version. So not sure if OP is wanting to find the American version or if they're really after the Korean version?,1
중립,"In terms of skincare, I stalked this sub for a few months and bought a bunch of stuff that kept coming up as recs at Olive Young. I would have booked a beauty treatment but finding them and then having to WhatsApp message different clinics was kind of overwhelming. Not sure how to help people with that other than, say, understanding the subtleties of certain treatments to narrow options and handle messaging to set up treatments based on availability, etc.",1
중립,Check the r/koreatravel Sub and search under kbeauty.,1
긍정,"Just something to note, unless you're doing something extreme like C02 laser resurfacing, most skincare treatments are not going to be effective as a one time thing. And most of the time, you need to space out treatments 4-6 weeks. 

If this is something you want to do and see significant results from, I'd only recommend going to Korea for skincare if you're staying there for a while. Yes, the skincare products are cheaper and have all these marketable ingredients but nothing is as good as getting actual procedures.",1
중립,Would you mind sharing your experience a bit in more detail via DM? It's a shame that treatments aren't accessible to all because of those problems,1
중립,"Mixsoon has a beta glucan serum too


I'm surprised iunik is breaking you out. There are only 6 ingredients: 1 in water and the other 5 are very common in skincare. You should cross reference the ingredients list with your other products. If you find that you're very acne-prone, you might have a sensitivity to one of these common ingredients ",2
중립,i think it's the acrylates :(,1
긍정,The mixsoon beta glucan is an essence. It’s super nice 😊,1
중립,Oh I didn't realize they updated the ingredients list with more stuff. Man that sucks. Hopefully the Mixsoon one is better for you,2
긍정,thank you!,1
중립,"I noticed that number 3 gives my skin a subtle glow, while number 5 helped lighten my tan and some pigmentation around my neck. I prefer using number 5 regularly, and I turn to number 3 whenever my skin feels dull.",3
중립,"I got the number 3, it has so many fermented ingredients that it gave me acne,used it for 2-3 times only",2
긍정,"Honestly, sounds like you need something like the HaruHaru Barrier Essence to strengthen and repair your skin barrier. If Numbuzin No. 1 toner isn't working, meant for soothing, the others might not work either. 

I love the Numbuzin No. 1 Suncreen. Just recently started using it. It helps in calming skin for me, but when the barrier is irritated due to the actives I'm using, it's the HaruHaru Barrier Essence to which I turn.",2
중립,"I love numbuzin but I really hate toner 3 because of its smell.
It reminded me of a very old toilet refreshner scent, I just couldnt.",1
부정,"I used to hate the toner vitamin toner but I'll tell you what it does, it makes your face looks glowly. I haven't seen any improvement in my pigmentation but it does make it look glowy.",1
중립,"I use the 5 in the morning, for an antioxidant boost, because I don't use a Vitamin C serum at the moment. And I use the 3 at night, its more hydrating without being greasy. One little  splash is enough, if I use more I feel sticky (with both of them)",1
중립,Do these both have niacinamide?,1
중립,I remember Missha had a tea toner in a big glass bottle. Can't find it anymore,1
긍정,Love love loveee the no.3 toner! It made my skin so glowy in just 3-4 uses,1
중립,"Found it. They changed packaging 


MISSHA Artemisia Calming Essence",1
중립,"And I see ppl recommended Im from Mugwort even more. Would purchase myself. But I have ordered laneige cream skin, which  isnt exactly calming but very hydrating, it is a must during heating season",1
중립,"Also live in Hawaii, used both. last time I ordered on stylevana, maybe 2 years ago it took around 2 months to arrive. It takes long bc each item has a est time of how long before it will actually ship to their warehouse. some is asap but some can take up to a month + the time it takes to actually get shipped to you. Just one of those items can hold back the entire order so I would try to only buy items with fast shipping estimates.i think yesstyle a lil faster but I haven't bought frequently enough to tell. on yes style it says theyll cover the tariif price and will refund u in credits if u get charged. Dk about styvana tarrifs though ",1
중립,Thanks for your reply! So those items that say “in stock - usually shipped within 24 hours”? Everything in my cart says in stock so hopefully shipping won’t take too long.,1
중립,Yesstyle suspended shipping to Hawaii so when I ordered from them I had it shipped to Canada because I went there for a vacation. It took a month lol because one item wasn’t in stock and because Canada Post had a strike.,1
긍정,"'cosrx advanced snail 92 all in one' it's kinda sticky but i really love how moisturising it is without clogging pores.also great before makeup instead of primer,foundation literally sticks to cream and face.bought it for 700rs for 50 ml or 1000-1050 for 100 ml
btw you dont need eye cream,mostly it's overpriced small moisturiser",2

중립,"Alltimate PHA Toner (AM only)

Isntree Green Tea Emulsion 

Numbuzin No. 1 Suncreen or Isntree Hyaluronic Sun Gel or BoJ Relief Aqua or HaruHaru Airyfit (I can personally vouch and highly recommend Numbuzin No. 1 rn. I do have BoJ RA and HH AF in storage, but haven't tried them yet)

HaruHaru Wonder Barrier Essence 

Alltimate Vegan Mucin Peptide Cream (Night moisturizer if needed)

These all cost under Rs. 1000 in sales, and will help you control sebum too over time. Personally using these while living in Mumbai. Sebum controlled quite a lot. 

You don't need a separate eye cream. I use BoJ Revive eye serum, but that's because I wanted a gentle retinoid for eyes, and I'm way old than you and have neglected skin care for decades. So, needed that. You don't. Just use the other products, except the toner as you don't need to use exfoliating acids around the eyes. 

I also double cleanse and use adapalene and azelaic acid, but you don't really need those. Just start with the above mentioned and see how it works over the next few months.",1
중립,"Try getting trial kits. Your favourite brand might do them you tend to get a face wash , moisturiser and something else usually spf. This way you have all the basic things you need for a lower cost than if you were to buy them individually. This doesn’t always work as sometimes the products are so small so always check the ml",1
긍정,"If Im on a budget, i would stick to:
1.) a good cleanser
2.) moisturizer 
3.) sunscreen 

If you have extra budget maybe a serum OR a toner. But I’d prioritize the three",1
중립,hi~ i have the roundlab toner if ur interested. im willing to sell it at an affordable price,1
중립,"Try toner pads for combination skin type! my fave is Skinfood carrot pads, they are very watery and full of toner, just put those pads on your skin for 10 min ish and apply moisturizer after that. that's my favorite routine (also I have oily/blackheads on t zone and very dry in night time)",1
긍정,"Try one of these sets:
•	The Face Shop Rice Ceramide Moisturizing Skincare Set: Budget full-routine. Includes rice + ceramide ingredients (good barrier support) and likely lightweight textures. Great if you’re just getting into this routine.
	•	innisfree Barrier Boost Korean Moisturizer Set: Mid-price; strong focus on moisturizer and barrier care (good for sensitivity). You’ll still want to pair with a good mild cleanser/toner if not included
            Sulwhasoo First Care Trial Set: Luxury trial size. Good taste of premium K-Beauty; might be more than needed texture-wise for humid climate, so check product feel (gel/cream).
•	HHBEAUTY Korean Rice Skincare Set: Ultra-budget. Good if you want to test things low-risk. May compromise somewhat on full size or premium packaging.
	•	Korean Ginseng Skincare Gift Set (Eye Cream‑Focused): This is more of a gift-style set with emphasis on eye cream + possibly fewer full-sizes. If your main missing piece is eye cream, this could pair with your existing cleanser/toner",1
긍정,"And I disagree. Toner or preferably and essence is important.  It helps the rest of your skincare absorb better.  I think having a hyaluronic acid based one, and an exfoliating one alternated is a great addition to a routine",1
긍정,Ive been using the equalberry toner and chasinrabbits eye roller and theyre both really nice!!! Chasinrabbits is on ulta so i buy from there and equalberry i got from a kbeautystore,1
긍정,"I GOT YOU, FRIEND! 🙋🏻‍♀️💯 TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner and TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Water Cream moisturizer are perfect for combo skin type. I have the same type and have used these for almost a year, my skin never looked better. They are high quality products, and come in large quantity, while being very budget friendly! The toner is 500ml for about US $20, and cream is 300ml for about US $12. I know it seems expensive, but keep in mind that most Korean toners are about 250ml for that same price, and with TONYMOLY you are getting DOUBLE (they also have smaller sizes available for lower prices)! While most Korean moisturizers are 150ml for about US $20. Again, you are getting double with TONYMOLY and for half the price. 😁 they will last you a good amount of time even with using 2x daily because they are so big! Plus, your skin and wallet will thank you. If you wait for Black Friday, they will go on sale on Amazon and Ulta, for super cheap. 110% worth it, if you ask me. 😅💕 I am not sure what form of dollars RS is, Rupees or Rubles? Otherwise I would have converted the amount for you, my bad.

My last opinion is that if you are trying to remain frugal, instead of using eye cream, use your toner, serums, and moisturizer on your eyes as well. Also, look into possibly purchasing reusable eye masks. The ones from We Love Eyes, are a bit expensive, but you can use them for a year or more! Just apply whatever skincare product you use on your eyes (doesn’t have to be eye serum), and apply the reusable masks! Take off after 30 minutes, clean, and repeat tomorrow. 🙂 not only do they help reduce waste, but you get a year+ of unlimited uses for only USD $20. Regular eye masks cost about the same price per tub, usually come with 60 masks, giving you 30 days one time use, or 15 days if you use them morning and night.

Hopefully I have been of some help to you, my friend!",1
부정,"Toner are just waste of money and is literally water most of the times but if you still wanted to get one, I'd suggest you to target your skin concern, i use the rounlab toner, it's hydrating and does gentle exfoliation. For moisturizer you can try the reequil one, i have the same skin type as you but I'm acne prone  too, safe to say it didn't break me out and was moisturizing enough. It's a gel based formula and is very light weight. I emptied out 3 bottles of it.",0
긍정,Man thank you for stopping from buying an eye cream :) but I’ve read comments where they say cosrx did breakout people?,2
중립,Ain’t both of em very expensive thou😭,1

긍정,Alright man thank you can you suggest a good cleanser for me thou? :),1
중립,Please check you dm,1
긍정,Aww thank you for the honest comment on toner! Also the reequil one will it feel sticky after wearing it? Will you recommend this as a daily moisturiser? I’m sorry I’m just new to this whole skincare fiasco,1
긍정,"I didn't have any problems with cosrx and i was using it with tretinoin. I also agree that the eye creams are a hoax and you don't really need it, better invest in a good good cream and spf.",1
긍정,"you're welcome! well i have combination-to-oily problematic skin and it was totally fine with cosrx.but also you can try 'celimax the real cica soothing cream' (a bit more than 1000rs for 50ml),perfect for combi skin",1
긍정,"It’s not so much COSRX causing break outs as it is the snail mucin ingredient. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work for everyone. I broke out from it too. I even tried the vegan Mixsoon Bean Essence alternative, and had the same issue. 😩 sucks because I actually really enjoy snail mucin essence and the glow it leaves. It is def worth a try though! It might be totally fine for you, and not break out at all! 🤷🏻‍♀️ you won’t know until you try it 🥰 the COSRX 92 Advanced Cream leaves your skin so silky smooth, it’s insane.

The trick with snail mucin is that you have to apply it to a damp face, but not dripping wet like after washing. Like immediately after applying toner, or spritz your face with some water in a spray bottle. For whatever reason, if you apply it to a dry face, it will be super sticky and not able to absorb properly. I dunno why, lol

COSRX also produces a lot of other really good products that do not contain snail mucin. Their propolis toner is fantastic, the overnight lip balm works really well, and they just released a ceramide skincare line that I have not yet tried myself, but I hear from my friends is amazing. Their aloe vera sunscreen is also a super popular item. The prices are really good too, especially during sales!",1
긍정,"If you have oily skin, then yes, if you can afford getting a good cleansing oil on sale, I would recommend double cleansing. I'm using the Beauty of Joseon cleansing oil.",1
중립,"I know you did not ask me, and are probably tired of me butting in on everyone else’s reply, haha, but I would actually not recommend double cleansing for oily skin. Doing so could possibly strip your skin, and cause it to over produce more oils to replace the natural oils being removed. Especially if you do not wear a lot of makeup. I only double cleanse at night, and *only* if I have applied sunscreen that day. Makeup like lipstick, gloss, and blush can easily be removed with your regular cleanser, or a milk cleanser which is like a 2-in-1 double cleanser.",1
중립,[deleted],1
부정,"Milk cleansers.

Foam cleansers are harsh on the skin because the bubbles are so dense, especially if they are not emulsified properly. Like if I just squeezed some out of the tube into my hands and immediately rubbed it on the face, that is actually very bad for the skin, like rubbing sand paper. If you absolutely have to use a foam, consider buying a marshmallow whip maker to emulsify the bubbles before using it on your face. This will thin the density of them, making it less irritating to the skin. They are cheap, I purchased a two pack on Amazon for US $5, and use one for my shampoo.

If you are willing to try milk cleansers, the biggest one I could find for cheapest price is Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser. It is actually my favorite cleanser EVARR, and what I currently use. I used to use foams, and had horribly oily TZone that looked like I had chicken grease on my face, with cheeks as dry as the Gobi Desert. When I switched to Isntree Milk cleanser, within two weeks my skin calmed down dramatically! Less oily, and my cheeks were not dry anymore! Within three weeks, my skin type did a complete 360, and for the first time in my life I had a normal skin type! My skin became balanced and the skin barrier repaired itself.

Hope this helps 🥰 let me know if you consider it and what you think if you try! 💕",1
중립,"🚨🚨🚨This could be a scam to steal your money, or sell you a fake product!! Be careful, my friend!!🚨🚨🚨",1
부정,"This is entirely FALSE, and only a matter of opinion, not truth or honesty. Toners are not “literally water”, or a waste of money. Please, do not fall for that! Are toners a totally necessary skincare step? No, they are not. They are completely optional depending on the consumer’s preference. Is the only ingredient in toners literally water? No. Peek at the ingredients list. You will find water as one of the main ingredients, yes, but that is because you have to create things with a base foundation. There are also a whole lot more ingredients in them than just that.

Like with cooking for example.. are cakes literally just flour? No. They have eggs, milk, sugar, and other ingredients to make them flavored and tasty! Right? 😋 haha

Think of toners as the first step of moisturizing your skin after cleansing. They are more like thin serums. Yes, they are optional for those who do not want or need to use them, but I promise you that they are not just “literally water”. 💕

People not well versed in skincare (I am not saying this about you, OP, I mean people in general) frequently have this misconception about toners because most of them are clear, and the brands promote marketing of “thin, watery consistency”. It is easily misunderstood if they do not do the research.

Some people also think this because when they use toners, they are expecting to reap crazy results from them almost immediately. Then they get upset when they don’t see the results they want. This just doesn’t happen for *any* product of *any* kind overnight. It takes time for things to produce changes, especially with skincare products. Just like with medicine, it can take skincare items up to a month, or even three months, for one to see the benefits of it. Consistency and patience is mando.

The last and biggest reason why people fall for this misconception is simply because of opinionated statements on social media, and the sheep effect. Don’t be a sheep my dear 🥰

PS: I am not calling you a sheep, I only said that for effect, lol. Also, I am sorry this reply is so friggin long 😱 my bad!",2

긍정,"Have you tried the Aestura AtoBarrier365 cream? It's filled with high-density ceramides that will help ward off the dryness. This product paired with the Sungboon Editor Green Tomato lifting ampoule should help with your dryness and pore concerns! You also mentioned that you use Retinol, though. How often and how much Retinol do you apply? This may be a reason why your skin is not absorbing the ingredients of the moisturizers. Also! (Pro Tip) It's best to apply moisturizing products onto damp skin. They're much better absorbed that way.",2
긍정,"Hi! For starters, I have combination skin, thin, prone to dehydration and sensitive. Also, I HATE the feeling of creams on my face, so I always look for light finishes.

I love the Purito Deep Sea Pure Water cream, but the've changed the packaging and, I guess, the formula too. I don't know about the new one. The old one feels light, soft, almost fake, like it's not gonna hydrate. But it does. You just need a bit, like a pea or two for the whole face and it gets absorbed like a charm. And the hydration lasts. It has niacinamide and panthenol and its soothing, so it calms my skins redness. 10/10. Gonna pray they haven't changed the formula.  
The Centella Unscented Recovery cream is also a favourite of mine, mostly during winter, when the Deep Sea one is not enough (in summer the Centella one is too heavy as I live in a VERY humid place). It's a must for sensitive skins or damaged skin barriers. During summer, if my skin gets burned, I use this and the burn heals super fast. Love it. But they've changed the packaging too T\_T  
The Dermide Relief cream is a bit too thick for my liking as a daily moisturizer, but a great help when a specific spot on my face is specially dry or sensitive or when I wanna make a cream/serum more heavy (for ex, if the climate changes for a few days and it gets very dry).   
I also used Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I liked it very much. You can modulate how heavy or light it feels because you can apply more than one layer and it still gets absorbed (unlike Purito's Centella or Dermide Relief, or other creams I've tried, that you put more on your face and just.....sit there, pilling on top of each other). Purito's Deep Sea (old version) is like this too. It's gonna be my salvation if the Deep Sea has changed :\_)  
I also have Purito's Oat In Calming cream but, AGAIN, they've changed the formula. But I've heard great things about the gel version. I've heard it has the best of the cream and it's lighter, so........... Imma buy it soon xD

The Deep Sea would be my top recommendation. With it's formula, it helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skintone, inflamation and hydration. It should still be a great hydrating cream. If not, the Klairs is great, but only for hydration.",1

It s a natural covering, very cheap and with a good lasting power",1
긍정,I am living in ireland and comparing to regular drugstore brands korean skincare is fab value . Like loreal nivea can cost more here than much better quality korean skincare. I am sorry you was not happy with suncream i bought cosrx aloe suncream and loved it ( used like 2 bottles ) its quite thick and great for dry skin so maybe was just not suitable for your skin type ?,15
중립,"Your country’s currency is low, that’s why. It’s cheap in Korea. 

And tariffs.. 

And inflation",46
중립,They are relatively cheaper here in Europe than local products. It could be about tariffs in your country.,7
긍정,"Stylevana has good prices, they often have really great discounts so maybe try there? The products are expensive for me too, so I pick the category I am willing to put a bit more financially into (even Stylevana prices are not small for my understanding) like sunscreen and buy from Stylevana since it is half the price compared to the same product that I would buy at a store that sells Korean beauty. (With the current codes I can get glow serum 60ml for about 10€ while it would be about 35-40€ in the store).


When it comes to having reactions that has nothing to do with price. You can react badly to any product, it all depends on your skin, allergies and other individual things.",3
중립,"I get what you mean about it being a gamble, not having access to testers, but it encourages us to be more attuned to what ingredients work for our skin. I have a spreadsheet where I list products and ingredients that haven’t gone well for me.

You’ll often get samples in your parcel so can be an opportunity to test new products too.",3
중립,"KBeauty is pretty expensive in Canada compared to drugstore brands. As many have mentioned unfortunately it is varaible for so many reasons!

Whenever someone goes to Korea we all ask them to go shopping for us there 🫣 paying for checked bags costs less haha.

Take a look at the ingredient list on the sunscreen that didn't work, at least. Then you can start to learn which ingredients you want to avoid, and save a little money on buying products that won't break you out.",3
중립,Meanwhile me looking at Korean products and wondering how they make them so cheap. Even my DIY isn't much cheaper.,3
중립,[removed],9
중립,"They’re expensive due to shipping costs and the difference in wages between countries (Koreans earn a ton afaik). You can get products cheaper on places like YesStyle (I use this) and Stylevana. Ive also found that ordering online from pharmacies is sometimes the same price if not cheaper than the sites I listed, but I’m not sure if this is the case in India.",2

중립,"Speaking in USD, when you look at the quality of ingredients and compare what the cost would be for something of that quality in the States, it's actually so cheap.",1

중립,"Does it have the electric impulses? My mini did, but they stopped. I def noticed a glow to my skin in just a few days and I’m 50. I’m thinking about getting the Age-R Ultra Tune. Have you heard if it’s better than the booster pro? Or is it basically the same?",1

중립,"Hi there! Just to ask - what shade are you? It'll affect the types of palettes you could use.

But, based on brands I would recommend the CLIO Pro Eye Palette Air, WAKEMAKE Soft Blurring Eye Palette  (if you're into sheer shadows), About Tone Return To Basic Eyeshadow Palette, LUMMIR Light On Eyeshadow Palettes or peripera All Take Mood Palette are some of my favorites :)",1

I can actually feel the celimax working, it might be the spicules helping it",3

중립,"Kind of depends on the finish of the product and your skin type. Also how long you want it to hold up for. How does it feel on your skin? Does it transfer once it’s dried down? With some products I can get away with just a setting spray to help it settle. With others I need a light powder if I need it to wear longer, especially if it’s more likely to transfer or settle into creases.",1
중립,"I think you can set it with a setting spray instead, using powder might make your base look cakey since it already has a semi-matte finish.",1
중립,"It’s a matte finish, and no it doesn’t really transfer when dried down, it’s basically waterproof. Espoir said that it doesn’t need to be set because of the finish idk how it will last if I dont use powder",1

중립,Have you tried TOCOBO Cica Calming Serum? It’s really lightweight and sets super fast. I enjoyed using/wearing it but the finish was a bit too shiny for my taste… I’m oily and afraid of glow though lol. It didn’t pill on me. I can’t speak to how it works under makeup.,1
긍정,"I love the Aqua Fresh tho... I’ve never experienced any pilling with it or reaction with it! For reference I have oily/ combo acne-prone skin! Make sure you’re using the original Korean formula, since the reformulated versions can feel a bit different in texture. You could also try the Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen or the SKIN1004 Hyalu-Cica Sun Serum. Both are super lightweight and layer well!",1
중립,Round Labs Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen. But I don’t understand how your sunscreen can pill hours after you apply it. You should not be touching your face so I don’t understand how it can happen.,0

긍정,"I think the formula is very nice and light, I've been wearing it almost every day under sunscreen for the past 2 weeks. It's definitely helping with my reddness from rosacea and I think it's somewhat helping my closed comedones though I'm not sure that could also be the retinoid i started using. It's hydrating and soothing and the azelaic acid isn't too concentrated so I can wear it without a problem even when my skin is irritated . 

If you want more of the azelaic acid benefits I'd go with the 15% version, I just felt like it would be too irritating for my skin at the moment",1
중립,Not OP but I did not and I have extremely sensitive skin,2
중립,"not op but i have very oily, acne prone skin and didn't experience purging with it. it helped my skin like no other !",2

긍정,Thank you!,1
중립,I use the ordinary copper peptides under my eyes and it seems to be helping a lot! Just keep in mind that it’s a more gradual result than something like retinol. My skin is too sensitive for retinol around my eyes.,1

긍정,"I recommend retinol. Even if it’s not specifically an eye cream, applying it all over your face really makes a noticeable difference. Most eye creams seem to contain a small amount of retinol, but I recommend the ones from iope and mary&may. For a retinol serum that you can use on your entire face, Innisfree is a great choice!",1

중립,"I have come to really enjoy the beauty of joseon - I use the cleansing balm followed by the green plum cleanser, which has mung bean also. The combination keeps my skin quite clear. Noticeable difference when I use something different.

Edited for typos - talk to text was not my friend today.",1
중립,"As much as I'd encourage people to only buy vegan products for ethical reasons, products containing a longer list of plant-derived ingredients are not inherently gentler... in this case both solutions are plant-based, but a. 20% lactic acid is generally gentler than 7% glycolic acid, and b. The Ordinary products, especially those with high concentrations of actives, are notorious for not being formulated with sensitive skin in mind, unlike the majority of k-beauty.

As a side note I recently started using that FULLY peeling serum and I'm very impressed with it so far, but I've only gotten to use it twice so it's too early to tell my full thoughts on it",6
긍정,"I’ve tried both, and I thought both were great!",2
중립,"I’ve tried both, but honestly, The Ordinary didn’t do much for me — I didn’t feel anything or see any big results. Personally, I like slightly tingling feeling after exfoliation. So about a month ago, I started using the Fully. I usually mix a couple of drops with my cleansing foam when I wash my face, or with my body wash in the shower. It gives me a bit of a sting, so I make sure to apply a lot of cream afterward. My skin definitely feels smoother now.",2
중립,What is your usual routine for the glycolic acid toner?,1
중립,"Axis-y pha glow peel. I use it on my rosacea and  it's gentle enough that it works without irritating it. I was scared by the word peel but it's a put on, leave on for ten minutes and wash off type of product",1

I personally use The Saem Cell Renew Bio Micro Peel Soft Gel as a gentle physical exfoliate and any of those mild “clearing” pads that have tolerable ingredients for my skin.",3

중립,"Big fan of the glow bb cream , expensive but worth itttt",2
긍정,I love the Purito one!,2
중립,Missha bb cream if you are on a budget! Tho it is quite on the gray side because koreans prefer a much fair complexion so it may not quite match if you are on the tanner side. But you can make it work by applying a light layer of it (it’s because it’s quite thick in my opinion!) I’m also trying the erborian bb cream but i just received it today so i don’t have any experience with it haha,2
중립,im on my 3rd bottle of “all about glow cover cream from chasin rabbits”,2
중립,I am a big fan of missha in the red tube.  I like to apply with a cushion puff.,2
긍정,"if you want something matte, Etude All Day bb cream.

my go to and popular amongst a lot of MUAs in Korea is the Cell Fusion Skin Blemish Balm Intensive, great for acne, breakouts, and pores - they will mix it with a foundation (atm the best combi is the About Tone semi matte foundation) if higher coverage is desired. all these aren't greyish toned and works really well.

personally not a fan of Erborian due to the shades, and it's a bit thick and the product needs to be worked into the skin.",2
중립,I like the glow one but it only comes in one shade and then you have to mix it. Not a skin tint but I’ve been enjoying the milk touch glow cushion,2

긍정,I second erborian. I love the primer with it as well.,1
긍정,Thank you for your recommendation! How did you find the shade match as in like did it matched your skin tone perfectly?,1
중립,Which one would you recommend the most out of them? ,1
긍정,"this is a good list! phymongshe is good but slightly pricey and i second the erborian recs above. 
missha is a classic but used to have a slight grey tinge, although i heard that they since improved.
please note that newly released products from etude and wakemake are less like bb/ccs and more like light coverage foundation despite the marketing.",1

중립,Does it apply better with a cushion puff? ,1
긍정,Thank you for sharing!! I will look into the cell fusion one!,1
중립,Are you using the new reformulated version of the cell fusion bb cream? I recently saw that they came out with a newer one without niacinamide and added two new shades! I ordered the new one from Amazon and it seems pretty thick so hoping it wont clog pores.,1
긍정,"I will look into it, thank you!! ",1
긍정,Thank you!! Will look into it ,1
긍정, I will look into it but it’s a bit out of my price range but thank you for your recommendation! ,1
긍정,"Love erborian, and cant wait till I get the primer!",2
중립,"At most there are, I believe, 5 options. Depending on the retailer, there are usually only 3 options. I use Clair which is their lightest and it blends right in.",2
긍정,"I don’t think it smudges easily. Or at least no more than my other products. It always looks nice on my face no matter what I do. You can get a sample at Sephora to try, that’s what I did since I wasn’t sure which shade would look best.",2
부정,"Hi! So a few days ago I received my erborian bb cream and did a wear test from 11 am until 8 pm! I would say that the bb cream is not bad, i think i just got a bit hesitant because the shade is bit lighter than me (i got the nude one because it’s the darkest that i could find) upon application i think it’s a bit overwhelming for me because it’s kinda thicker than the missha one but it’s still manageable as long as u apply them thinly! But on the other side, i got a small acne on my left cheek after using it but tbh idk if it’s really caused by the erborian cream (i did not experienced this with missha when i first tried it) 

For the overall experience, i would say that it’s the same with the missha one! I think it has a sheer to buildable coverage, and in my case, i only applied a thin layer to even out my skin and because the shade is a bit lighter for me. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin as well and did not peeled off (this might depend on your skin prep) 

If you have a fair complexion and you have a budget, you can opt for the erborian one, I only got the 5ml and it’s already pricey for its size lol. But if you want to save money and have a diverse shade options, you can get the missha one. ^^",2
중립,i know they also have a “tone up” cream which i use for overall redness/ tone correction,1
긍정,I prefer it over a brush or beauty blender.  Fingers also good but I don’t like getting it under my nails!,2
중립,"yes I'm using the new version. it is thick when you squeeze it out of the tube, but it blends like a skincare cream and mixes well with other foundations. I either use it alone or blend it with a serum-like foundation for a more skin like finish, or with a matte foundation for more coverage. usually bb cream 2:1 foundation ratio.",1
긍정,Thank you!! ,1

anyway for moisturizing though the illiyoon ceramide concentrate cream is AMAZING for hydration + soooo rich + affordable. borderline changed my life! it's so rich you might not want to use it every day but it's definitely worth trying out.",1
긍정,"i use mostly fungal acne safe products and my skin is pretty dry and sensitive because i'm using a benzoyl peroxide cream.

this is my routine rn, my skin hasn't felt dry since i started on this routine. i've checked the ingredients on folliculitis.


- [TirTir Milk Skin Toner](https://tirtir.global/collections/skincare/products/milk-skin-toner): it makes a huge difference in terms of moisture, the only time my skin looked crusty was when i ran out of it 

- [Hado Labo Lotion Super Hydrator](https://hadalabotokyo.shop/products/hada-labo-tokyo-super-hyaluronic-acid-super-hydrator-lotion-for-age-18-39-150-ml-bottle-pack-of-1): i use this every day AM and PM after the toner/any actives to lock in everything. it 100% helps my skin retain any moisture but it doesn't do much just on its own

- [Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/snail-mucin/products/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence): heard it breaks some people out, hasn't done it to me tho. nice for an extra kick of moisture. it's super gentle, it was one of the only products that didn't make my face feel like it was on fire when i first started using benzoyl peroxide

- [Beauty of Joseph Rice + Probiotics Suncream](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics?_gl=1*fdralv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlCdnlMB0wxQmL_NGNdTKNZwzHPvxRXM59_-EAVczdkyZy9Ap-e8GeIaArrXEALw_wcB&gbraid=0AAAAAp9LuYQ4ifStx8wbrUcbxCuSBza65&variant=43264254476453): it has ONE ingredient that gets flagged by folliculitis scout, but it was hard finding a suncream that was completely FAS (and available in ireland). i did use this [Boots](https://BootsSPF+InvisibleFaceDailySuncareFaceFluidSPF5050mlhttps://www.boots.ie/boots-spfand-invisible-face-daily-suncare-face-fluid-spf50-50ml-10344819) brand one which is FAS, but it would pill so badly and felt so thick. [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/) website has a massive list of FAS products, but i would double check everything on the folliculitis scout ingredient checker


i also tried these two moisturisers before settling on this routine:


- [La Roche Posay Toleraine Sensitive Fluide](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/toleriane-sensitive-fluid-moisturiser/LRP_914.html): it only has 11 ingredients but one layer is barely moisturising, and the price for the amount of product makes it not worth layering

- [Uriage Bariederm-Cica Daily Gel](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/bariederm-cica-daily-gel-cream) it was definitely more moisturising than the la roche posay cream, but it left a weird film on the face that i didn't like",1

- angel’s liquid bha exfoliating body wash is my holy grail. i’ve gone through so many bottles and i can definitely see a difference in my skin. for context, i have keratosis pilaris so my arms are uneven in color and i definitely have seen more evenness in my skin and decrease of bumps. if you don’t have kp, i think you’ll see even faster results.

- cocoon an giang palmyra palm sugar body polish. i promise you that this will be a different experience than any other body scrub because it not only exfoliates but makes your skin SO soft and dewy after. i’ve tried so many body scrubs and usually think they’re often too drying. only con is if you’re sensitive to smell you might think it’s too strong, but i personally love the smell and after you wash it off there is a very small skin scent trail. the smell to me is like sweet ginger no bitterness at all. 

- medicube body peeling shot. honestly this is extremely affective, but i hate the smell and often times find myself avoiding using it due to the smell, even though i like the results.",3

For body acne, I tried Medicube red acne body peeling shot. I didnt like it. The spray stopped working after the 2nd use. The smell was strong and harsh.
I really enjoyed the Kaine rosemary relief body mist, it's gentle and worked very well for me. I also applied it on my legs to exfoliate and will definitely repurchase this one",1

긍정,"Hi! I recently came back from South Korea and my fav products are from Innisfree. I love the Green Tea line, it works very well on me. 

For sheet masks, I literally bought every single one they have at Olive Young because I was bringing back gifts for friends and family. I prefer masks that have cica and are calming, and hydrating. 1. Torriden Balanceful Mask, and 2. Round Lab Pine Calming Cica Mask, are the best in my opinion and I just ordered more!",1
긍정,"Personally I went a little crazy at Olive Young, and wanted to try the famous products from the past couple years but I learned that most things did not suit my skin e.g. Manyo cleansing oil burned my face and the S.Nature Aqua Squalene cream broke me out. I learned that Innisfree products give me the best hydration and keep me glowing! I wish I grabbed more of those than shopping at Olive Young",1
중립,"Protein bars and zero sugar snacks! Since I live in Asia, a lot of popular Kbeauty products are available online and even in my country.

It’s great for dry skin to top up without ruining makeup and gives a dewy look over makeup. So annoying I didn’t buy more. Everything else in olive young is pretty much available here but ofc less of a range and more expensive.

Earrings and shoes definitely.

Also more crazed pottery.",2

부정,"Oh, definitely- the adorable skincare and those little pod cosmetics from Korea are on a whole different level. Everything looks so beautiful that you almost feel bad for opening up the packaging. 💕 And don’t even get me started on their moisturizing treatments and sheet masks.

Honestly, part of the fun is just showing off the cute packaging, and the rest is pretending you’ve mastered that whole 10-step routine. 😅",1
중립,yes. Olive Young is a bit expensive store. So we usually go there during promo days(Olive-Young Day). Protein bars and zero sugar snacks are very popular these days!,1

중립,"I’m the same! Korean sunscreens are fine for daily light sun, but for summer and extended outdoors I’m using LRP for body and Isdin for face. They’re just so much stronger.",1
중립,"Sort of - a lot of the Korean brands have different formulations that they sell in the US that use US-approved filters, not the more advanced filters that Asian brands used. It can be difficult to know if you're actually getting the better sunscreen, because the bottle might be exactly the same even though the formulation is different.",2
중립,"The US FDA is enforcing the ban on non FDA approved sunscreens. Some stores/online retailers with US locations/warehouses still carry Japanese &/or Korean sunscreens, but they will be difficult to get when the supply runs out.",2
긍정,"Yes it is but the price isn’t that different from buying it here in Australia, usually only ₩5,000 or so unless it’s a 1+1 pack.

I usually use La Roche Posay Anthelios anyway as I prefer the finish and feel it gives more coverage outdoors but I agree if you don’t have access to them they’re great and there is a huge range.",1

긍정,"Same, S Nature and Roundlab are nice to wear in winter and when you’re not in the sun as much as they’re lighter and more skincare like. They’re also good in somewhere like Bangkok that has pollution shield some of the UV. 

But LRP is better coverage and strong as you said (from experience) and I wear it to the beach too and still not heavy. I’m on tret too so I need to be careful. What’s Isdin?",1
중립,Wow.. maybe I didn’t notice it on my trip this month. Having FOMO now 🥹,2
중립,"Isdin is a Spanish brand that my derm recommended me. It’s a tinted sunscreen and at first I thought she was trying to upsell me one of the clinic’s partner brands or something; but then I wore it in the Dominican Republic for a week, laid out in the sun every day, and my melasma on my cheek that’s stubbornly been visible through every single product I’ve ever tried for the past decade+, literally disappeared by the end of the week. No other product changes, I couldn’t stop showing my husband my face in shock lol. I’m definitely a convert to it!",1
중립,Do try next time for sure!!,1
중립,"I have normal to dry skin that’s pretty sensitive. I’ve started with the 100 and really like it. I do it probably every three days. I feel the tingly sensation the night I apply it the most, but it kind of disappears quickly and isn’t bothersome. When I do my morning skincare, I feel the tingle again, but much less. So I think the spicules take a while to dissolve. But to be clear I only feel it when I do my routine. After that, I don’t feel it.",3
부정,"I have been using Isntree Plum Peptide Booster 2000s for a couple of months, it wasn't too bad at all. Felt the obvious prickly sensation on the first time, thereafter I don't feel them that much because I got used to it  I guess? Idk. Everyone on here seems to be saying how uncomfortable their 1st experiences on VT Reedle 100 with some saying it hurt so much that they didn't continue.

So in my book, VT Cosmetics is the frontrunner of this spicules thing and they are sort of the benchmark to compare all other comapnies' spicules products. Since my first experience was with Isntree, and it was pretty mild, I thought the VT 100 would be a step up for me -- at the point I was thinking maybe the Isntree is only comparable to VT 50 perhaps in terms of sensation.

I just tried my first VT 100 a couple of days ago and I thought THAT was even milder than the Isntree? I hardly felt anything at all. So that was a surprise for me. I also have the 300 sample so I'll try that maybe in several days' time see how it feels.

In terms of effects and benefits on my skin, I can't really tell. My most problematic issue is my melasma. I'm hoping by using spicules, it would help anti tyrosinase inhibitors work much better, but melasma is a tricky thing if it's hormonal as even if the epidermal and dermal layers are being treated, the problem will still persist if systemically the hormones are doing the devil's work non-stop lol",1

Does it sting when u use the pore pads? If no to all of these I don’t think you have a compromised skin barrier. How long have u had this routine? It seems like a pretty solid one, and I wouldn’t want to recommend u add anymore actives if you’ve only been using them for a month or 2.",1

If I were you I would ditch the pore pads and get a gentle 10% azelaic acid cream. I’m not sure ab kbeauty options bc I use the ordinary’s bc its really inexpensive and I can get it at target.

긍정,thank you for the suggestion! how often should I use it? and where in my routine?,1

중립,"I wouldn’t use this product. It has far too many allergenic and sensitizing oils in it. The formulation incorporates a lot of citrus oils to give your skin a glow, and the other oils are for fragrance. But all of them are sensitizing, and shouldn’t be used on your face. Bergamot oil in particular is pretty nasty—it can cause contact dermatitis very easily. 

Also, you didn’t show the whole ingredients, so the retinol is not even visible. But it must be very low on the list. Not worth it.

You can get a MUCH better retinol product than this. I think you should toss this one.

Edit: Here it is on incidecoder. You can see all the problematic ingredients flagged here: https://incidecoder.com/products/c-k-d-retino-collagen-small-molecule-300-cream",4
중립,"I don’t believe it has retinol in it, I don’t see it in the ingredients list?",3
긍정,"So looks like this has 0.01% retinAL (a stronger retinoid than retinOL) which is roughly equivalent to 0.1% retinOL. That's a good beginner concentration (0.1% - 0.3% retinOL is what's usually recommended)


With retinoids, you want to make sure you're wearing SPF daily, not just the day after. Start with a small amount once a week (PM only) and slowly increase the frequency as tolerated. With retinoids, frequency and consistency is key. You want to use the highest concentration your skin can handle daily rather than a super high strength one infrequently. Retinoids are best on dry skin after cleansing and before the rest of your routine. But if that's still too irritating for you, you can use it with/after your moisturizer to buffer it until you can tolerate it better


That all said, retinAL is a very unstable ingredient. So without a good formulation, the retinAL will lose strength and won't be effective. And looking at that ingredients list... I really wonder whether it's a stable formula",3
중립,My skin shriveled up looking at that list,5
긍정,"I'll try to use it treating it like a really strong retinoid, just because I already spent my money on it 😭 thank you. Ig it gives me another reaction, I suppose I'll gift it to someone with strong skin.

The picture I took I was thinking more about the instructions to use it, so like this were just a regular moisturizer.",-3

중립,Right?? It’s contact dermatitis in a bottle.,4
긍정,"People cannot give you instructions on how to use a product without seeing the entire list of ingredients. The usage depends solely on the ingredients. But the point is irrelevant since I looked it up myself. 

You’ve had one reaction from the product. I’m not sure why you would give it a chance to give you another reaction. It’s full of phototoxic and photosensitizing ingredients. But good luck.",2
중립,Oh thanks. I went to check if the product had the same composition as I saw in sites. This collection releases so many similar products it's a little difficult to me to make sure I got the right one,2
중립,"Botanical extracts and essential oils can be irritating, especially citrus oils (they're even photosensitizing to an extent). Some people have more sensitive skin than others and can't tolerate them at all. Some are fine with them. The presence of botanical extracts isn't a deal breaker imo. But the amount, variety, and types in this particular product is *exceedingly* unnecessary. So much so that it makes me instantly doubt that this product is formulated well and turns me off from the entire brand. It feels like they don't know what they're doing 


I don't have a specific recommendation because I haven't really tried any. My skin is very sensitive to actives. I just cracked open the Iope super bounce serum (0.015% retinOL, super low) and I already have to be careful with it damaging my moisture barrier haha... 


I suggest looking at products from well known brands and produced by a reputable manufacturer (Kolmar, Cosmax, etc). You want a product that comes in opaque, air-tight packaging (no dropper bottles). Also do you due diligence and make sure the products actually have the % of pure retinOL or retinAL that they claim. There are many that actually have a lower percentage but use the total concentration of derivatives on the label to draw in consumers. I've personally landed on Iope after a lot of research and for a multitude of reasons. But there are quite a few Korean retinoids on the market now",2
긍정,"I didn't have a reaction from this product. I had a reaction from another product (one that is not asian beauty, in my country the beauty products tend to be too harsh). I read that AB retinoids are less sensitizing and searched for one that I saw good reviews. But I was confused by the lack of instructions, since I know retinoids are something to use carefully.

I didn't want to bother you, I'm grateful for your help. I didn't know the full list of ingredients is so important, I was only thinking about the lack of instructions. I'm really new into AB and I never used retinoid until 3 months ago.

You said that there's better options, could you tell me products I can look for?",2

Sephora is carrying the Biodance Collagen Mask to Foam Cleanser though and they are getting ready to do their fall Beauty Insider sale at the end of the month. Yami is another retailer to check out but their selection is limited and you need to make sure that you select items that are “fulfilled by Yami” because they ship out of Yami’s US warehouse.

중립,I saw videos from 4 months ago still saying that’s the way to authenticate… i don’t know any more 😥,1
중립,"Anyways there is a qr code printed on the little white solid plastic sticker used to  seal the box. 

To verify a JMsolution product, scan the QR code on the packaging using a smartphone camera or a QR code reader app. This will take you to an authorized website where you can check if the product is genuine by looking for details like the product code and a ""genuine"" confirmation on the page. Alternatively, some products also come with a magnet card for a second verification method. 

Steps to verify a JMsolution product using the QR code

Locate the QR code: Find the QR code on the product's packaging.

Scan the code: Use your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app to scan it.

Go to the verification page: The scan will direct you to an official JMsolution verification website.

Confirm authenticity: On the website, check the displayed information to confirm the product is genuine. Look for a red ""genuine"" word, a product code, and a scanned count. 

Alternative verification method (magnet card)

Some JMsolution products include a magnet card.

To use this method, place the magnet card near the upper right corner of the mask's verification area on the packaging.

The verification area should display a green stripe effect, indicating the product is authentic. ",2

중립,Not sure about the other products but I’ve never found Burt’s bees products to work. I swear they leave me more chapped. ,2
긍정,"What is your skin type, and what type of skin issues are you trying to address? 

This would not be enough for me in the winter. Since you're asking specifically about winter, I'm going to guess you might have dry skin in the winter? I have a similar issue (but I also have rosacea, which makes my skin barrier challenging).

In my opinion, a good winter skin routine is something like this:

1. Wash

2. First essence (something like Mixsoon Bean Essence or ma:nyo bifida biome toner)

3. A milky toner that's a bit richer (maybe Purito Oat In Silky Toner or Tirtir milk toner)

4. Moisturizer (I really like Skin1004 Enrich Cream)

At night, a thin occlusive on top to keep water from evaporating from your skin overnight. Something like Abib Rice Probiotics Overnight Masks is really good.

The ""first essence"" gives you very gentle exfoliating and skin barrier support. The milky toner gives you a bit more richness. Moisturizer is to add lipids and richer ingredients on top. And the occlusive keeps your skin from losing water - we tend to lose a lot of water from our skin at night.",2
긍정,"Depends on your skin. If you’re oily, serums might be plenty. But I’d consider adding a moisturizer as well. I love the celimax dual barrier cream!",1
중립,"??wait, don't you know the Tamisense?",1
긍정,wow...thank you so much for advising!! I used to use the milky toner but it was very thick and oily for me. maybe i just don't like the texture. any other solutions?,1

중립,small amount as blush or minimalist eyeshadow? or mix with another tint for a gradient,1
중립,Hmm i did see a tutorial on diluting lip products with concealer. Will try that thanxx,1
긍정,"I've been singing the praises of Erborian for the past year. I believe their bb cream is silicone free. It blurs better than anything I've ever used. I dont even wear full coverage foundation anymore. I just use this bb and a spot concealer, and my skin looks amazing.",1
중립,"Huda, caliray I think milani too. Many silicone free options",1

중립,whats your skin type?,1
중립,"Dry, but prone to some breakouts near my period. Otherwise sensitive. I have eczema and psoriasis.",2
긍정,Toss it for sure. Any changes in color or smell means it's not safe anymore. Don't play around with your eyes. PAO for most eye products with an applicator is 3-6 months for a good reason,4
긍정,"ahh I see so many things I have and love!! the mediheal madecassoside toner pads are so nice, I adore the smell. I also got the hydrating and collagen ones coming this week and I'm excited to try! also pls lmk how you like the dr g red blemish essence!",4

긍정,"I haven’t tried most of these products before, so I’d love to know what you all think of them! I have dry sensitive skin and i’m trying to switch to a k beauty routine so for skincare I got-


TirTir Ceramic Cream, RED blemish Clear soothing active essence, mediheal pads in madecassoside, collagen and watermide, several mediheal masks, and round lab birch juice sunscreen plus free samples


For makeup:

Rom& glasting water gloss, peripera ink velvet, clio superproof pen liner, clio kill cover conceal palette, rom& milk tea velvet tint, etude water tint, fwee blurry pudding pot, touch in sol no pore blem primer, and the laneige smores kiss set!!",1
긍정,"The Fwee pudding pots are currently my favs. I bought 5-6 pots of it now. 
I love those toner pads you’ve got too.",1
중립,How much did it cost??,1
긍정,happy to report the blemish essence and madecosside have seemed to do my skin good! my redness has gone down significantly and my texture looks a tiny bit better as well. the ceramic cream seemed to be a bit heavy on my skin and causing redness unfortunately so i went back to my Dime blue facial oil as moisturizer and that seems to be working well for now at least,2
긍정,"oooh awesome!!! i’m excited to try them too!! a kbeauty store was having a closing sale so i got a great deal on all three, idk if i should use them all at once alternatively depending on what benefit i need that day? the store lady’s main recommendation was the collagen.

but yeah i’m dealing with horrible dryness and breakouts despite using multiple moisturizers so I’m hoping these products will be the switch i needed to make !!",1

긍정,This is so great to hear!!!!!! Off I go to add the essence to my cart lol,1
중립,"i do layer my toners! i'll use the madecassoside and then pat a collagen toner pad on after that for extra hydration. if you're dealing with dryness, i'd first use the hydrating toner pad (gently wiping it) and then pat your collagen pad on your face once it's absorbed! use the madecassoside for when you're about to get a pimple or having irritation/breakouts (I use it daily cause im a sensitive skin girly) and you can def use the essence after your toner after it's absorbed!! :)",1
중립,"I would advise against using the toner pads altogether at once. Finish up one first before opening a new container. 

Do they not sell refills of the toner pads? You could next time just buy the refills and wash/dry the container before refilling to avoid contamination.",0
중립,"3 stores in los angeles koreatown, they were all in California Marketplace- Aritaum, Nature Collection and  Doginbi, paid $300 for all this",2
중립,Try the Wakemake blurring pots too if you haven’t. They are so cheap and I bought all the colours!,1
부정,"300$ for all this isn’t very bad(considering tariffs and whatnot) 

But I would say u could def get double the amount if done online ",1
중립,Why do you say so? Just so you don’t overwhelm your skin?,1
긍정,"This is a fixing spray. It’s a really good ultrafine mist fixing spray, I’m currently using this.

Setting sprays melt your makeup together, fixing sprays fixes your makeup.

I use setting sprays on my sponge then blend my makeup, and a fixing spray as the last step in my makeup to hold everything together.",4

I don't have a Korean pass number, so I can only use the global one, but is kinda incomplete.",1

중립,Maybe you got a fake or it doesn't work with your son type?. This is literally the only fixing spray I've ever used that worked. I have oily skin too. Wish I could still order direct from their website,1
중립,"??? Are you sure? I’ve been using it for months and it’s fine mist. All the descriptions online also mention ultrafine, microfine etc.
I’ve used other sprays like Urban Decay, Charlotte Tilbury, Shu Uemura etc, and I can guarantee that Fixx is the finest out of them.",1
중립,I bought it on Yesstyle so doubt it was a fake :(,1
중립,"I have the mini version, maybe it's not the same as the regular one? Or maybe my expectation for an ultrafine mist are too high",1
중립,"Mayhaps haha, the mist feels like when there’s a waterfall, and the water mist is in the area.",1
긍정,Hi there 👋 This product looks legit to me. It's normal to have multi european language because it's mendatory to sell in EU (If you live in Italy it must have the labels in Italian). So it's actually a good sign. Most of fake products come from china and doesn't have the european package.,7
중립,"Write anua and send them these pictures. If your only evidence is that you “heard” Amazon sells fakes, that isn’t much to go on. Anua sells direct on Amazon. If you are paranoid about fakes, buy from the website directly. 

No one can look at these photos and tell you this is inauthentic *except* for anua.",5
중립,"Not necessarily, like other posters have said, could be due to requirements in your country/region for selling cosmetics. However, I would caution you against getting anything you put on your body (like cosmetics and skincare) or anything you ingest off Amazon. Amazon warehouses often store all products of a kind together, regardless of the seller. So even if you buy from a brand’s official storefront on Amazon, if there is someone also selling a counterfeit version of that product, you might get that instead. Better to buy from retailers that only get products directly from the brand and not from a website where basically anyone can sell things.",4
중립,Should have a batch number on the box/jar you can look up on checkfresh.com or you can also compare the ingredients on their official website and see if they match.,1
긍정,"As others have mentioned, it’s very normal for brands to over label or put stickers on the products as the instructions need to be in the language of the country the item is being sold in. Best to check with Anua themselves though",1
중립,"For a quick solution, go to [Anua’s official website](https://anua.com/products/niacinamide-10-txa-4-serum-2), and download or screenshot a picture of the bottle front and back. If they don’t have a picture of the back, the front should be enough. Fake brands have to alter labels, images, and text on the bottle to avoid being sued. Look at your bottle, and zoom in on the screenshots, comparing both. If everything is exactly the same, you have an authentic product. If there are any differences, even as subtle as a dot somewhere that does not appear on the bottle in the screenshot, then it is fake, and you should return it ASAP.

To avoid this in the future, when shopping for skincare on Amazon, look under the “Add the cart”, and “buy now” buttons. You will see some information that includes; ships from, sold by, returns, gift options. Make sure that it is SOLD BY the brand itself, or says something like “Anua official”. Not something crazy like “fjtieaodytnyogisbwyeignri” or “Jane’s Lane”, regardless of the seller’s ratings. Many brands will also have a link on their website that lists verified retailers. If Amazon is not included, I would look elsewhere.

I know it is tempting, especially when there are deals on Amazon you don’t see otherwise, but spending the money on an authentic product is absolutely 110% worth saving yourself from unknown, potentially harmful impurities in fake products. Even if this serum is authentic, I would not risk buying from that store again. The next serum might be fake.

I used to buy VT Cos Reedle Shots from Amazon, I have purchased at least 7 bottles. One of those bottles arrived totally empty, another came broken and would not pump, and a third was fake. That’s when I quit buying skincare from Amazon entirely.

If you are still tempted, go on social media and search “reaction fake skincare”. That should change your mind. 🥰",1

긍정,Real Barrier Extreme Cream is my holy grail night cream. I use the Real Barrier Extreme Lotion for daytime. I love it so much that I have a drawer full of about 10 refills that I bought from YesStyle before the tariffs hit. You can find it on Amazon but it’s like 2x the price.,2
중립,"My all time favorite is chasin rabbits golden ruler, or drjart yellow tube",1
중립,"I think the real barrier cream has too many extracts/ essential oils in it for daytime wear. But aesura, zeroid, and illiyoon have the same ceramide technology without the additional extracts, so they are similar and preferable to me.

For glowiness, I recommend Biodance essence glow moisturizer. Or, you can just layer humectants under any moisturizer (unless it’s matte) and get a glowy look.",1

I have very dry skin, can be very sensitive too & clog prone but i do use chemical exfoliants, and this cream has been a game changer for me.

I’m on my 2nd tube now in about 6 months.I kept breaking out for WEEKS in 1 spot on my cheek. (It’s a whole different story, I was going through some health issues that caused acne/stress) either way, this cream cleared up my breakouts fast and without leaving scarring. It’s lightweight, and can be used alone for a moisturizer. I personally will wash, tone, use the 147 cream, and a light moisturizer on top. It has been lovely! And it’s easy to find on Amazon.",0
중립,"The Numbuzin lifting essence is a bit sticky until it absorbs, so you may want to use it at night. My glow doesn't go away. When I get out of the shower, my glow is still there. 

Regarding the Medik8 moisturizer, it really produces visible results in less time than other options. That claim is substantiated by not only me but also a few of my friends. My friends turned me on to it.",2

긍정,Illyoon is occlusive. Using it along is going to do more harm than good. ,1
긍정,You can try other moisturizer but there is no perfect moisturizer. Every skin is different. You can add up a hydrating toner and layer it twice. Betaglucan is a good humectant give it some time to work. I would consider adding oil to your moisturizer at night. I have dry skin and I add oil in my routine.,1
중립,"Hi, my skin is very sensitive especially to moisturizers. How hydrating I need my moisturizer to be depends on the weather and also where I am living. I have always found it easy and had to layer the moisturizers. So please try that. Try one of the ones that already works and something else for repairing your skin barrier which seems to be damaged. 
I found Torriden Solid in Ceramide cream lightweight and moisturizing and depending on the need, I need to layer. Ceramides help with damaged barrier so I am trying this too. And also if there is redness and inflammation you can also look at something with cica. ",1
긍정,i use a really good humectant and have bought a toner but the moisturizer itself is just waxy and overall not good. i want something more hydrating and glowy instead of creating a weird dry film,1

긍정,Torriden is so good frfr,1

중립,Seriously. I don't know why it took so long for me to find the brand. I am thinking of slowly phasing out the skincare I use and find Torriden alternatives and call it a day. ,2
긍정,thank you! i havent really used a moisturizer that has worked for me yet but ill definitely be on the look outt,1
부정,i do use humectants but the moisturizer doesnt lock it in whatsoever and is bad under makeup/makes my skin bunpy and itchy,1

중립,I use the excess as a serum for a few days afterwards. I just keep the open packet propped up on my vanity and pour a bit out when I want to use it. Haven’t had any issues yet but usually chuck it out after a couple of days.,5
중립,Ingredients because I recently bought a few that are TOO juicy and it feels annoying and wasteful. I’ve been kind of squeezing the mask out as I remove it and saving the juice in a clean travel container to use on my body with body lotion but that’s annoying.,3
중립,"I have masks for different uses, I have one that I use consistently on weekly basis, some specifically to use pre-event, post-sun exposure etc.",2
중립,"Depends on why I'm sheet masking. 


Prepping for a big event? Any hydrogel will do. 


Hydration? Will pick based on long-lasting hydration/amount of serum and sheet mask feel/quality


Overexfoliated/irritated? Damn straight I'm looking at ingredients. Madecassoside please!",3
부정,"Ingredients do matter to me a lot, and really determine which sheet mask I choose for what concern. However, texture is also really important to me for sensory reasons, so if it feels bad it's not going to be something that I will repurchase.",1
중립,Are sheet mask serums the same concentration as their bottled version?,1
중립,"Tbh I stopped buying. What I do now is apply my favorite serum to my face and then diy a mask (soak a dry / compressed face mask in a mix of warm water + glycerin). This way I reduce the price per mask. Even though you get a lot of product in the face mask it seldom has enough preservative to save for later use. 

At the end of the day what I want from a sheet mask is hydration, which I feel that I achieve with this diy version, and the benefits from the actives I get from my regular skincare products.",1
중립,Definitely ingredients- that’s the only way to be sure what it’s going to do to your skin and tailor for what you need right now.,1
긍정,Same! Love the YINA biocellulose masks for this (their c beauty but the best mask ive found for healing and brightening),2
중립,Recommend TAMISENSE Sheet Mask,1
중립,Have you ever tried TAMISENSE Mask?,1
중립,They are a more wasteful version of a serum for the most part.,1
중립,I think so..? That's actutally I prefer sheet mask with a lot of serum in one mask,1
중립,What's your favorite serum?,1
중립,My favorite is the purito centella unscented serum! :) very hydrating and calming on my periodically sensitive and irritated skin (use adapalene / benzoyl peroxide to treat acne).,1
중립,"Aestura Atobarrier line / Dr Jart+ Ceramidin line

Both are medical beauty brands. Developed by dermatologists and recommended by dermatologists.",2
중립,"Your description is basically me + sensitive skin and I’m super lazy. I can’t really be bothered with a bunch of products and anything with too many ingredients messes with my skin so I’m definitely not an expert.

With that being said, my skin really likes the basic [COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.ulta.com/p/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-xlsImpprod15641052?sku=2504912) and I use it almost everyday. I recommend you try out some discovery kits like this [COSRX](https://www.ulta.com/p/viral-preppair-kit-pimprod2045109?sku=2624299) or [Peach & Lily](https://www.ulta.com/p/glass-skin-discovery-kit-pimprod2014552?sku=2561116) (I just bought this and my skin has been liking it so far).",1
긍정,"Just quickly: Glass skin can be achieved easily by layering humectants (toners, essences, and serums) heavily and sealing them in with a glossy moisturizer (or non-matte moisturizer). Mists sprayed over the whole thing when you’re done can help even more. The key is layering the humectants first until your skin looks dewy. 

That’s a cosmetic approach to the glass-skin look. But a more holistic and natural approach is to get your skin barrier in tip-top shape. When your barrier is in good shape, your skin will have a natural bounce and elasticity, which will make it look soft and dewy.

For both approaches, it is helpful to add ferments to the list of humectants. Ferments make your skin glow if you layer them. Missha 5x revolution, benton fermentation essence, and mixsoon galactomyces are all glow-makers. The glow will heighten the glass-skin effect, and ferments are generally good for skin conditioning in general. 

I made of list of glowy products a while back, maybe it will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptidesProducts/s/FDr3Yccrtf",1
중립,"Since your skin leans very dry and gets flaky in winter, I’d start with barrier-focused hydration before layering anything too active. A lot of people jump into K-beauty essences or toners, but what actually helps long term is replenishing the lipid balance. Look for oils or serums that combine squalane, moringa, borage, or marula — these mimic the skin’s natural sebum and deeply hydrate without heaviness.

I formulate small-batch skincare myself, and the biggest mistake I see is skipping nourishment for the barrier. When you give the skin the right fatty acids and antioxidants, it naturally starts to look like “glass skin” because it’s balanced — not because it’s coated in layers. Try introducing one nourishing oil under your moisturizer at night and you’ll probably see smoother texture within a week.",1

중립,Have you tried doing sock curls?,2
중립,"I think this first pic is my hair. Second pic is usually heat made imo. I have a couple pieces that curl kinda barrel like you said, but most do this wave. I’ve learned that frizz is inevitable with wavy hair because we just don’t have the stronger shape to keep it down. I don’t mind it, I like it. 

Idk what it is you want, and I don’t feel like reading it again. It sounds like you don’t like it when it’s too freshly tight, just use a light oil and scrunch it out. I live where it’s cold and dry so I don’t wash daily, so for extra hold I use olaplex curl gel/ verb curl cream (the old version ONLY. new orange line sucks). The first day is very shiny and tidier. I wash at night and dry only my roots, so I sleep with my hair wet and splay it above my head when I sleep and it’s pretty curly and voluminous when I wake.",2
긍정,"I am korean and had that hairstyle, have both tried heat styling straight hair and perming. To perfectly replicate the models in the photos, it has to be heated styled. Perm alone does not give perfect blocks of wavy hair like the second pic. But loose perms called 구름펌 can achieve similar looks using some blow dryer skills and curl cream. With only perm and no styling it just becomes fuzzy.",2
중립,"If you have a hairdresser who is Korean, Chinese, or Japanese, ask if they can do it. Digital perm is quite popular for quite some time (more than 10 yrs Id say) in that part of Asia. So if you have a China town or anything similar nearby, chances of finding a digital perm place is high.",2

긍정,"I see a lot of people mentioning perms, but if you're not necessarily wanting this style every single day, you might try using a beachy wave/texturizing spray or leave in cream. Believe it or not, there are some good ones that don't make your hair crunchy. I mention this because you already have some wave to your hair, so it shouldn't take much to achieve this style. Just use a volumizer at your roots and scrunch up your hair in handfuls toward your scalp when it's damp after applying the texturizing/beach  wave product and it should dry just the way you want it. I'm actually jealous of your barrel waves haha the style you want is my natural wave but I'm always longing for loose barrel curls 😆",1

중립,"I'm 2a, my hair gets very frizzy. Cantu Wave Whip Curling Mousse makes my natural hair look like your first picture. It doesn't make it crunchy at all.

Also, for me at least, 'S' waves appeared when I got a layered haircut.",1
중립,"My hair gets similar curls from my sleeping hairstyle. Twist the hair (the whole length) and put it at the same time in a bun.
It you twist it tightly, the curls are smaller/tighter. 
When you comb it, the curls get looser again. 
Don’t twist the ends too strong or the curls in the last few cm will get a bit too tight.",1

중립,Looks like “hippie perm”,1
중립,I have a Bed Head crimper that makes my very straight and fine hair look so similar to this! I use it once a week and the crimps last until my next wash about 2-3 days later (i get compliments every time i use it!),1
긍정,I would say try Korean hair products. Kundal shampoo and conditioner has a good reputation amongst Korean people with naturally curly hair. The mise en scene curl essence is an affordable leave in cream to do away with frizz.,0
중립,[removed],-3
긍정,"Yeah I think I’ll try that! I thought of trying it but I wanted to post on Reddit to see what other people would say first. And yeah their hairs definitely heat styled, and honestly I wouldn’t mind heat styling but I just don’t have the tools for it and I can’t find any tutorials either. If i wanted hair like this but more permanently would perming be a good option? I have wavy hair so I just would want to change the shape of the waves instead",3
중립,Do you do multiple braids?,1
중립,"No no braids do not give these specific curls. These are big curls, braids give more of a smaller dry beach waves look. Look up braid curls OP",1
중립,"Thing is I already have wavy hair so I’m wondering how this would work? And even then I’d have to style it, wouldn’t it just be better to style my natural hair?",3

중립,Yep this is the answer,1

중립,I was considering buying that! Does it work well?,2
긍정,Thank you for the suggestion! And we should totally switch LMAO s shape waves seem so much easier to handle,2
중립,Do you have any recommendations for a spray/cream?,1
중립,"Does ur natural hair have an s shape or a barrel shape? Because I’m worried that using a mousse would just make my barrel curls more defined instead of giving me the s shape, and it might only work for you since you already have that. And I do have a layered cut, which makes my hair look more voluminous and curly, but still not s shaped",1
중립,Yeah a perm would be able to do that!,3
중립,I do 2!,1
중립,Braid waves can look kinda similar to the first pic. But yeah that’s why I said they’re likely heat styled or permed lol,1
중립,"doing it will change the shape of your curl pattern to a looser wave and technically you shouldn't have to do much styling once the perm is in place compared to trying to loosen up your own waves each time you wash it.

If you aren't doing anything to it at all right now, try the braiding technique mentioned in another comment. If you don't like the results you could try a perm later on.",3
중립,I use the revlon 3 barrel waver it’s like a big crimper. Super easy,1
중립,"it does, i purchased it on amazon (i think) and it has a US plug so i don’t need a converter. i use it on the weakest settings and it works well on 1b hair",2
긍정,"I've had good luck with the Ouai brand both the wave spray and the curl creme, but my sister really likes the Living Proof texture spray. YMMV, but the Ouai ones have always left my hair soft, which I really appreciate because some texture sprays can be crunchy and no one wants that!",1
중립,"I would say my natural hair is super uneven - It has a ton of barrel curls combined with some naturally 'S' shaped, like more elongated (?) waves, and in other sections is almost completely straight. 

Sometimes - and I mean, on the very odd day that my hair decides to cooperate, I can get my hair looking like your second picture, but that definitely involves heat (a VERY wide curler) and some anti-frizz oil. 

You have a point here, but maybe you could try, Cantu is pretty unexpensive and even if it doesn't work, you might use it as a styling product if you decide to use heat to get the hairstyle you prefer.",2
중립,For sure — a perm would work perfectly for that look.,1

중립,"Tirtir is notorious for oxidizing, I bought like 4 diff shades in their mid 20s range when I was trying to shade match, and yet they all made me turn orange at the end of the day lol. If you don’t want to waste it, what worked for me was adding either a lighter foundation or a blue or white mixer into the cushion. If not, Unleshia has a good cushion that doesn’t oxidize. 32N might work for you?",1
중립,"I use the TirTir Aura Cushion Foundation (silver packaging) in shade 29N. It does not oxidize on my skin like the red one did, and it is much easier to apply. The finish is semi-sheer and slightly dewy. In fact, I like the Aura so much that I bought a couple of backups.",1
중립,[removed],1
긍정,"Since you really like the shade match, you could also try adding a drop or two of a green (green counters orange/red) neutralizing color corrector or using a green shaded tone up base. Many brands make color correctors that will do a great job, but make sure you get a liquid one and not a cream so you can blend it with your foundation. Jung Saem Mool and d'Alba both have green tone up bases, and I know there are several liquid color correctors as well, but I can't remember the brands off the top of my head. 

If you're looking for other foundation brands, the Hera and Jung Saem Mool cushions have a very good reputation for the quality of their formulas and for not oxidizing, although both are a bit pricey.

Good luck! 🙂",1

긍정,"It might still be worth checking to see if there's a match for you in the JSM cushion cuz I'm suuuper pale and it hasn't been too orange for me in their lightest shade, but of course YMMV!

Hello all,

After years of struggling to find the right sunscreen this was my absolute holy grail for the past 4 years or so. I have dry and sensitive skin and my skin reacts really quickly to products that it does not like. Soon Jung's mineral suncream helped my skin stay clear for the years I've been using it. But alas, I realized that this product may no longer be widely sold anymore. I recently tried the Cerave Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30, but my skin did NOT like it.

That’s me right now 🙈. I could easily pay triple to get my hands on the remaining ones of this fantastic sunscreen.


I have literally tried at least 20 sunscreens from Yesstyle and all the ones mentioned here often, nothing compares to this gem.",21
중립,"It’s sadly no longer on the website so it is definitely discontinued, but I also still sometimes see the odd one at 711 😄",12
중립,Ugh. Using this right now from my sunscreen stash. It’s really nice. That is too bad. It was not quite my Anessa Mild Milk HG but it was a fraction of the cost of Anessa.,7

There were only 2 out of the many I visited that still had it in stock. I know sunscreen expires in 2-3 years so I came back to the USA with like a stash of 4-5 them. Hopefully it'll last me until then!",2
긍정,"I was just in Japan a few weeks ago and was able to find 5 bottles of it! Make sure to check behind the other Skin Aqua products, all the way at the back. That’s where I found them each time!! I found them all at konbinis… 7/11, FamilyMart, and Lawson!  Best of luck 🍀✨",2
중립,"For some reason, there's still plenty of it on Amazon Jp as well.
When it was announced to be discontinued, i was so sad. I decided to try out its successor, the Skin Aqua Hyaluronic UV Serum, low and behold I like it even better.

Plus the Serum is much cheaper than the Milk (900 yen for 70ml vs 900yen for 40ml)",1

Mercari has new ones at a scalper price but reasonably priced ones seem to have occasionally popped up there as well, maybe check occasionally.

중립,"Vit A and it's derivatives have year long-study proven results.

Bakuchiol, for all intents and purposes, just hidrates your skin very well. It's OK to like it, but until there is actual scientifical proof for anti-aging, retinol gang stays unbeaten for me 🤷🏻‍♀️",92
긍정,"The science behind bakuchiol just isn't there, it might be a nice ingredient but it doesn't work like a retinoid. Michelle/LabMuffinBeauty has covered this a couple times.

I hate tret/retinoid peeling and dryness so I get wanting an alternative. I struggled trying to use tret for years before I switched to retinal, which has been incredible, though the strong retinal formulas aren't AB, I get as good of results as I did with retinoids but with no irritation at all.",37
중립,I can only do bakuchiol because I'm breastfeeding so I am just thankful for something antiaging,10
중립,"Bakuchiol cleared up my skin like nothing else; redness, blemishes and dryness all sorted. I tried retinol but my skin is so sensitive it just didn’t work out. 

However, I’m finding bakuchiol harder and harder to find in skincare. If I have to, I’ll give retinol another go but start gradually with a very low concentration.",14
긍정,"For those loving bakuchiol, which products are giving you the best results?",4
긍정,Bakuchiol for now! I can’t use retinal on my entire face atm (I use it on my nose only) so Bakuchiol is my go to. I love the Haruharu Black Rice Knight Serum. It has 1% bakuchiol and the 0.08% retinol is negligible and I can still safely wax.,4
중립,Retinol is the only one of the two that give rapid cell turnover. I've been using tretinoin for 37 years and several years ago I decided to try bakuchiol and it did nothing for my skin.,5
중립,"On this one - tretinoin. 
I tried multiple retinol and bakuchiol serums and they did very little to me ( late 40s) . I finally figured out Tret routine and it actually works.",13
중립,"I do both. Bakuchiol is in most of my Korean products for AM. Retinal PM. I use bakuchiol liquid mixed with madeca cream on my eyelids, back of hands, and neck. They are complementary.",6
중립,"Butt coochie oil all the way.

My skin usually hates everything but it immediately loved it.",21
중립,"You can do both. Bakuchiol in the morning, retinoid at night",6
긍정,Retinol - had a little irritation when starting but since have built up tolerance and my skin is looking great. It also tends to be less expensive for the stuff that works the best - tretinoin.,2
중립,0.025% tretinoin saved my skin ,2
중립,¡Bac..uchiol AM and PM!,2
중립,"Neither. It may not be irritating but also remember that Bakuchiol does nothing- it’s just a plain moisturizer or hydrating serum. It’s mostly psychological! This Bakuchiol vs retinol thing is so 20 years ago!! It’s 2015!!!

Ranking is

**Tretinoin - prescription > Adapelene - otc in America > Retinaldehyde**

If you’re worried irritation etc use Retinaldehyde 

Bakuchiol is nothing. Retinol is not even worth contemplating 

I use tretinoin because of the existence of online app services. They mail the tret to  your house and my insurance covers it . I used retinol/Bakuchiol then Retinaldehyde then adapelene then tretinoin. No interest in tazorec currently ",2
긍정,"retinoids are just simply more studied and are proven to work and formulated to work well, doesn’t mean bakuchiol isn’t good but we just can’t say; there are so many different products these days that i’m sure you can find a retinoid product that’ll suit your needs, somebymi has the purple retinol intense line with retinol, retinal and  bakichiol, it’s really good of you want to have the best of both",2
중립,"Retinol, i like to feel a little tingle.",2
중립,"I prefer a plate of fresh french fries over bakuchiol, they’re about as related as with retinol",2
긍정,"My face does not like bakuchiol at all for some reason, so I stick with retinol. I used up the rest of my bakuchiol product on my décolleté and I did like the results but the irritation I got on my face was not good.",1
중립,Retinol,1
중립,"I used retinal for 1.5 years and I loved the results but at one point it started giving me dermatits and causing a lot of sensitivity without helping my acne anymore.

I don’t know if Bakuchiol lives up the retinal results I used to have, but no more skin irritation so that’s a massive win for me!",1
긍정,"Okay so per Harvard health, bakuchiol does increase cell turnover but in terms of potency, it's not at retinol's level. It's a good option for people who don't have significant signs of aging but want something mild and less irritating. Retinol also works quite a bit faster but you can use bakuchiol twice a day. I'll stick to my tretinoin lol but one of my friends swears by bakuchiol and she managed to do a 180 with her skin so I think she's onto something too.",27
중립,Oh. I thought it was proven to be a mild alternative to retinol.,3
중립,Which retinals do you use?,3
중립,How often do you use bakuchiol? Would using a bakuchiol serum every night be too much? 💗,2
중립,I use the 10% one from Neogen Dermatology!,6
중립,"Ah ok. For wrinkles, dark spots or acne?",0
긍정,Nice.,1
중립,I lol’d at what I imagine was your autocorrect 😂,16
긍정,"Made my day, thank you. 🙏",4
중립,I know but I still prefer bakuchiol. Skin-sensitivity issue. Did use a serum that had both ingredients but my face just didn't take it well.,1
중립,"I thought so too, someone posted a helpful article here once I’ll see if I can find it",3
긍정,"not AB, but the Meditk8 Crystal retinal line is amazing. I do like the BOJ retinal eye cream but it's super mild and low percentage retinal, works great for dark circles though",5
긍정,I love the Geek & Gorgeous retinal line!,1
중립,Me too!,1
중립,"Wrinkles and dark spots. 
Mostly wrinkles, sadly.",5
중립,"Acne too! It heals it like no other.

I found both prescription tret and Retinal from Krave (US-based Korean formulation -- creator is Korean and manufactures and tests in Korea) were similar to me. Prescription tret will probably be cheaper, like prescription azelaic, so it is worth seeing a derm.",2
중립,Omg I’m dying. I was like wtf???,9
긍정,Good thing your comment was there to guide me at 3am because I read it thrice and Im like ??????,5
중립,can i ask what your tret routine is like?,1
중립,"I currently at 3 times a week. It took some time and multiple products to try before I got there. I also realized I was starting from too strong concentration and going up too fast. 
I am using Hers tret, it works for me better than others I tried . In the morning after nothing super active ( it can be on other days, morning after still potential for irritation) - either Rohto whitening or Direia exosome lotion and Anessa sunscreen.",2
긍정,thank you!,1
중립,Yes. Sunscreen is arguably the most important thing in my routine. It has more value than having 5 toners or 6 serums that don’t do much and so I try to keep my routine fairly minimal even tho I’m a skincare junkie,1
중립,Y'all can afford to leave the house in this economy?,1
중립,"Im from Canada and I’ve been lucky that I’m actually overstocked on spf. However, i ordered from Skin1004 directly for quick shipping on a gift and didn’t realize they shipped from the US and got hit with $30 in customs fees. Yeah, I’m pissed cuz i could’ve just purchased these in person but wanted to take advantage of the discount and accessibility to a variety of products 😢",1
중립,"yes, especially since i started tret a month ago",1
중립,Check out Yami. They ship from California super fast and still have Asian formulations available.,1
중립,"Absolutely.

Aside from the fact skin cancer is nothing to joke about, there's the fact that UV rays cause photo aging at a rate that would completely erase the benefits of my other skincare products. I've cut back on other indulgences to finance the sunscreen, because it's not strictly an indulgence. I consider it necessary.",1
중립,"Tropical country. The sun is deadly. If it can cause a migraine with just 15 min sun, imagine the impact in skin. Tbh I only started sunscreen in my late thirties due to lack of awareness. Now I always put it if I'm going out of my house. I carry umbrella if I walk outside need to go under sun.",1
중립,Yes if you’re not applying the correct amount you’re not getting the labeled spf,1
중립,There should be plenty of kbeauty suppliers that ship from local warehouses,1
중립,"on no-makeup days i reapply every 2 hours.

on makeup days, i use the recommended amount but only in the morning and no reapplication.",1
중립,"Yes. Although I’m not in the US. I usually order from Yesstyle. I use Anessa, in the summer because it’s sweat and humidity resistant, it’s also the pricier option. In the colder months I use the Skin Aqua Toneup Essence which is cheaper. 

Otherwise, I have family in a few places in Asia whom I visit every other year so I usually do a big stock up. Sometimes people visit me in Canada too so I do ask them to bring a few things for me 😬",1
긍정,"Used to neglect using sunscreens and when I do apply, I don’t reapply. Now, I’m using the recommended amount and reapply the same recommended amount every 2-3 hours. Then again I have several superficial basal skin cancer excised from my face and body due to years of sun damage, so SPF is basically healthcare more than skincare for me.

I also purchased quite a few good UPF clothing to use when the UV index where I live reach 7+ or when I travel to countries where UV index reach as high as 11 such as Australia.",1
긍정,"i order from olive young in bulk whenever they have good coupons, which tbh is pretty frequently esp if you use the app",1
중립,"I’d rather not be broke AND ugly.
Also, sante brand and Moida I believe still have original Kr sunscreens",1
긍정,"Yes, I'll either go with a k beauty I'm stocked up on from stylevana (I haven't had shipping issues) or an American body sunscreen that doesn't have too occlusive of ingredients (I like beekman For face and body, LRP sport in the big tube w little blue banner, or HG and best deal Jack black SPF 45). Eucerin body would also work on my face but is DEWY. Most body stuff I wouldn't put on my face but Dr dray turned me onto these and they don't break me out.

There are a few websites you can buy k beauty from the US but I find them expensive",1
중립,"Yes! It’s still accessible even in the states, you just gotta know where to order from.",1
중립,i kept trying to stretch my sunscreen and now i’m panicking i won’t have enough before my new order comes and i keep refreshing tracking like it’ll magically be here sooner lol,1
중립,"Yes, it’s the one skincare I can’t skimp on. If you’re not using enough coverage, it’s like you’re not using it at all.",1
중립,Only when I go outside ☀️ I get my Stylevana orders within 1-2 weeks,1
중립,I just wear a hat tbh. There is nothing else that keeps my melasma from flaring up. I even have a winter knit beanie with a wide brim.,1
중립,"Sometimes. 

I'm an office worker, I use 3 pumps of skin1004 for my face if I'm heading to the office. WFH day, maybe no sunscreen or 2 pumps if I'm near my window.

Rarely 4 pumps for the face (which iirc is the recommended amount). I mean... I'm just not getting that much sun although I'm in Singapore. My life is sooooo indoors.

My face is noticeably whiter than my arms so now I have to put body sunscreen.",1
중립,I get mine from Yami and continue to use the full amount because it's kind of pointless trying to make it stretch if I'm then not protected from sun damage. I don't reapply unless I'm actually doing something outdoors for hours though.,1
중립,"I did not grow up wearing sunscreen and it's hard to really get into the habit when it's like 20$ a bottle for just a few weeks of uses. I think I might just continue believing in melanin, covering up, and being a hermit",1
긍정,"I use a tinted spf 46 as makeup (non AB), which goes over my Skin1004 hyalu-cica waterfit sun serum. I stocked up at the beginning of the year and my stash is good through to 2027.

Not sure what happens after that. Sigh.",1
중립,"I have really gotten in hats and cover up always. And hiding inside. 

But no I’m not scrimping on sunscreen when I need it. 

I’ll use western sunscreen if I have to, ugh.",1
중립,Seconded. Sunscreen is my fave skincare item.,1
중립,lol this is the core of the issue right here,1
중립,Moida only sells westernized sunscreen formulations without the next gen filters :(,1
긍정,I love a good tinted SPF! Which one do you use?,1
중립,Non AB so it will get removed. 😁 I tagged you in a recent discussion on another sub.,1

중립,I use the celimax retinol serum and shot combo and it works well for me. Make sure you ease into it,3
중립,Celimax’s Retinal shot. It’s 0.1% retinal - comparable to western retinals. It also has Matrixyl 3000. I wouldn’t get any AB products with retinOl. Only retinAl and they have some pretty decent formulations with it!,3
부정,"I'm sorry. I'm going to be blunt. Retinoids in most East AB is crap because East Asian people in general have better skincare routine and access to healthcare than the west, so they don't care enough for potent retinoid in their products. OTC retinal creams from South East Asian countries, on the other hand, 👏👏👏. If you want retinoid, go straight to tret if you are in NA or Europe. Most AB products with retinol in their label have less than 0.01% retinol.",3
중립,Beauty of Joseon Revive. It’s listed as an eye cream but you can use it on your face.,2
긍정,"My favorite AB cosmetic retinoid is Be The Skin Vegan Retinal Bakuchiol Serum. It’s on the stronger side and I definitely advise caution if you/your skin isn’t used to retinoid. My skin looked fantastic and had this really lovely glow I don’t know how to describe haha.

The only reason I don’t currently use it is my insurance covers prescription tret and that means a little extra money in my pocket.",1
중립,I like haru wonder Bakuchiol/retinol serum.,1
긍정,"If you’re new to retinoids, Asian options are actually a great way to start. **Innisfree’s Retinol Cica Repair Ampoule** is super beginner-friendly and pairs well with hydrating toners. I’ve also used **Dr. Different Vitalift-A** for a stronger retinaldehyde step once my skin adjusted.

Both gave me that smoother, refined texture over a few months without irritation.",0
부정,"I've tried prescription retinol (Tazarotene) and OTC adapalene (LRP), both ended up way too irritating and drying. I was about to accept the fact that retinoids weren't for me, but as a last-ditch effort, I picked up the Anua Nano Retinol Serum. Holy crap what a gamechanger! I'm able to use it daily with zero irritation and dryness. It has 0.1% encapsulated retinol which makes it more stable and better absorbed. I also appreciate that it has 5% niacinamide and peptides. Very innovative product.",-1
긍정,Wow.  I LOVE this article! Thank you!,3
중립,This is an incredibly interesting article. I'm gonna really sink my teeth into this tomorrow at work ,4
중립,She’s the goat I swear,1
긍정,"You don’t need a retinoid to be potent for it to be effective. AB does a decent job of formulating retinol with good ingredients that preserve your barrier. This is also desirable. There’s a lot of emphasis on potency on this sub, but ingredients can be effective in lower amounts—retinol is one of those ingredients.",4
중립,Recs on the SEA retinal creams please!,1
중립,which Southeast Asian OTC retinal creams would you recommend?,1

긍정,"Usually when something is OOS forever on OY Global you can't even see the option.

But this particular release would be returning November 16 to OY KR, so maybe it'll be back on global then too. Keep checking, I wouldn't lose hope until they remove the option. Even then, I once found a LE peripera set a year after I was discouraged from finding it anywhere.

If not, try Beauty Box Korea, but they have expensive shipping and can really be a hit or miss on service, but I think it's the most accessible and easiest forwarding service for KR exclusives. I can say that my experience in July 2025 was good but I only ever shipped to Canada.

긍정,"I have oily combo and I find it hydrating but best layered if you’re looking for maximum hydration.

I mostly use it on my body though.",3
긍정,It suits mine really well! It does require layering for best results though like the other commenter said :),2
중립,Do you need the remover even with fibre lashes?,1
중립,True! I have done that before but always forget when I'm running out 😅,1
중립,I did see improvement in my skin texture - nothing radical but some smoothening definitely. I don't have that many fine lines so can't say about those.,3
긍정,"I think it depends on what you're looking for - the propolis toner is great for hydration, and the booster tackles also texture and hyperpigmentation issues. 🤔",2
중립,"I buy it in Japan, as I usually travel there once a year and stock up then.",1
긍정,"Ooo that’s awesome!  Thank you for sharing!  I have oily skin and live in a hot and humid climate (though I can tend to be drier in the winter time), so the Naturie Hatomugi products work well for me!  I wish they’d come out with some cleansers, honestly.  And maybe an occlusive or barrier cream.  Their products are so lightweight and seem to be good for sensitive skin, too, so I think they’d make a lot more money if they could really offer a full range of products!",3
중립,is your combo skin dry or oily leaning? because i might have a similar type to yours as mines combo with oily leaning and it’s dehydrated on top too… i’d really want to try out the cosrx,1
중립,"I live in a hot and humid climate with oily skin, and I'm using all 3 products!

I think the milk would be more suitable for nighttime because it does leave a type of film on top. It would interfere with sunscreen and make up application.

Using the gel+milk before a retinoid has been sufficient to act as a barrier but with all the benefits.",2
중립,"Leaning a little more to oily, I usually have normal-ish cheeks and pretty oily t-zone especially since I have bangs :)",1
중립,Ooo same skin type and environment!  Your comment is so informative!  Thanks for sharing!,1
긍정,okay thank you i think i’ll try this out if the ordinary doesn’t work for me,1
중립,Where did you hearing that it's DCed?  I've only seen that it's increasingly tough to get in the US because of tariffs/sunscreen regs.,2
중립,"If I remember correctly, this one had a super subtle shimmer/glowiness to it. Is that right? And if so, is that something you want in a recommendation?",2
중립,"They livestream on TikTok, and I asked. They said they no longer make that specific spf, but their new one is ""similar"".",1
중립,This was super popular but probably discontinued because of their demonstrably false claims of SPF50. ,1
중립,"I don’t remember it being shimmery or glowy. It was more of a silky texture, which I really liked.",2
긍정,"Oh lord i remember it being such a turn off for me bc of how greasy it made me look. With that in mind, I recommend boj the popular sunscreen, the Canmake mermaid gel. All great, just super greasy on me",1
긍정,"Oh interesting! I can’t remember exactly the consistency of the cosrx one but the only reason I didn’t repurchase was because I didn’t love the shimmer it left on my skin. I’ve read some other reviews and see that some other people had that experience too. It may have just clung to my facial fuzz differently, but the sounds of it. 

Around the same time I bought the cosrx aloe sun cream, I was also using Thank You Farmer Sun Project Water Sun Cream and Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel. I have acne-prone and sensitive skin, but didn’t have any reaction to either of these.",1

중립,"I dust Shiseido baby powder over the top. If you live in a warm city or you’ve got oily skin, sunscreen will have that sheen.",35
중립,Have you tried the anessa? That one leaves me pretty matte.,10
중립,The House of Hur weightless sun fluid gives a soft matte finish. You can try that.,9
중립,"I’ve had the same problem, and for me, it actually came down to what I was using before applying SPF. My skincare routine was making things look shinier than they needed to be. 
It can also depend on your skin type. If you’ve got oily skin, that can definitely make sunscreens look extra greasy or shiny. 
If you haven’t tried already, go for mineral (physical) sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They usually have a more matte finish compared to chemical ones. I really like the Haruharu Wonder Pure Mineral SPF (purple tube, yellow cap). You can also use a mattifying moisturizer or primer underneath to help keep the shine down. Makes a big difference, especially if you’re self-conscious about it.",12
중립,"I feel you, I also have oily skin and on top of that tend to sweat in the face quite easily. [The Matte sunscreen Stick from BoJ](https://BeautyofJoseonMatteSunStickMugwort+Cameliahttps://share.google/7BCz7jAg7fDXwiS65) has been a life saver for me!! 
I use any kind of not-to-greasy fluid sunscreen in an appropriate amount and let that sit for a bit. I finish off by going over my face with the stick and the feel and look is DIVINE! I do use it for the matte effect rather than for protection in its own (I believe it’s not super water/sweat proof and you’ve gotta take care to spread evenly with the stick) and for reapplication throughout the day! 
It lasts me a long time and reapplication throughout the day has become enjoyable rather than the icky must-do it’s been before haha",6
중립,"i've been hunting for some matte sunscreen as an oily girl and I've got a couple hits so far! 

i liked the aestura derma uv mineral sunscreen, dries down quite matte but since it's mineral it might have a smidge of a white cast (im quite pale so it's a bit harder for me to tell, might need more input on this one). 

there's also a japanese sunscreen that got a bit viral last year called by365 powdery uv cream, it comes in tone up and non tone up. I can attest this one is actually matte, i can't tell if there was any white cast with the non-tone up one but it's pretty cheap when i got it at donki in japan, roughly the price of biore aqua rich 

but bear in mind, usually with matte sunscreens, applying makeup on top gets a bit tricky depending if the foundation / cushion you're using, there might be some pilling issues if the base ingredients don't play well with each other",5
긍정,"Have you considered that they’re just looking at you in a normal way?

Oh but a lot of chemical sunscreens are shiny on oilier skin types. Have you tried Skin 1004? If you want a physical sunscreen, then Dr. G is good too.",4
중립,Try a serum that has zinc pca that totally got rid of my oiliness. I had the same experience with all sunscreens. Its just your a bit oily and sometimes matte dry you too much so it produces oil. Hydrating is too hydrating and dewy so it adds to the shiny/oily look.,3
중립,"it depends on how dry your skin is to begin with, BUT YES, sunscreen filters are oils or have to be soluble in oil, so they are always always and forever oily to some degree. The mattest sunscreens I have ever used are Eucerin Oil Control Face and Haruhara Wonder Black Rice sunscreen

like others have mentioned, after letting the sunscreen set for 30 minutes, powder it a bit with a transparent powder. I use two thick layers of sunscreen, before powdering it up and then leaving the house, because I cannot reapply throughout the day",3
중립,"Have you looked into japanese sunscreen? A lot of them have alcohol so they dry down quicker and can be more matte. I got the Omi Sun Bears Active Protect Cool for my male partner when he traveled for work, and he was impressed at how non-shiny it was",3
중립,Idk about a matte sunscreen but you could use a translucent powder on top to minimize the shine. I like the Innisfree no sebum mineral powder for this. Do note that you can’t re-apply on top of the powder because it will pill.,2
중립,"No. I use a mineral sunscreen that dries down perfectly matte. Most mineral sunscreens do. If you want something with less shine, look for a sunscreen with mattifying ingredients like dimethicone, silica, starch, oats, and zinc. Or just use a mineral sunscreen.",2
긍정,"It’s not Asian brand but I’ve found the La Roche Possay factor 50 shine control one to be pretty decent. Sets in nicely and doesn’t leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. 

I have Round Lab I got last month in Korea to try, hopefully it’s a good one.",2
중립,I feel like there is always some shine. You could always try to powder or use SPF powder. I live in AZ so if I'm not wearing a hat I'll use the super goop SPF powder or jane iredale SPF powder in my hairline. I've had sunburn on my hairline once it was not fun. I was at a festival and I didn't have a hat plus who is going to put lotion sunscreen in their hair?! You just have to make sure you reapply the powder,2

중립,"I use epionce sunscreen and it is so matte on me. I have normal-dry skin. Do not recommend if you have oily skin as I’ve seen videos of people who really dislike it and feel like it’s some gooey layer. For me, it’s quite the opposite",1
중립,colorscience makes sunscreen that comes in powder form. it’s called sunforgettable,1
중립,"I like the shine.  I find BOJ has more of a shine than skin1004.  Round lab have one I hated because it left a white cast and had to be rubbed in but had no shine.  The other was completely different. 
Birch lab moisturizing sunscreen with the blue band was shiny.",1
중립,"there are matte sunscreens, for sure. 
Missha's Soft Finish All-Around Safe Block (i have oily skin and find this one too drying except in summer), the Aqua Sun version of the same is also quite matte but I can use it year round.

Cosrx Ultra Light Invisible Sunscreen is my go-to lately

Celimax Oil Control Light is supposed to be matte but i haven't received my order yet to find out for sure!",1
중립,I use Omi Bears Active Protect and it's not the least bit shiny. And it controls my oil all day. Never experienced anything like it ,1
중립,There's an ultra affordable sunscreen called Omi Sunbear that is quite matte! It is milky and I make sure to rub it in without streaks and it literally gets more matte throughout the day idk how it's kinda crazy,1
중립,"House of hur sunscreen (yellow bottle) is the only truly matte asian Ive ever used, there is zero shine, seriously. A close second is toccobo sunscreen in blue bottle i would say this one is more of a skin finish. Most times i would skip moisturizer in the morning because a lot of asian sunscreens are moisturizing enough but now i use a gel-cream moisturizer, and combined with sunscreen there’s no shine",1
긍정,"I recently bought the HaruHaru black rice sunscreen and i am absolutely in love. 10/10 recommend, it is the first sunscreen i’ve tried that doesn’t make me feel like i need to put translucent powder on afterward!",1
중립,[removed],1
중립,or use a sunstick,1
중립,"No, matte sunscreens exist, European ones are pretty matte. I have found Asian ones to be more dewy but also more moisturizing.",1
중립,Can someone explain difference between Matt and dewy finish I have seen these terms used alot in sunscreen but too embarrassed to ask someone and also which finish is better for oily skin peeps?,0
중립,some of them have an initial shine and eventually dry down to a natural or matte finish! haruharu airyfit dries down to a natural finish and anessa mild sun milk dries matte. house of hur (yellow bottle) also dries down super matte!,0
중립,"Do you reapply with a gel/cream type sunscreen? I’ve been thinking dusting powder over my sunscreen to avoid the shine but then wonder if upon reapplication,it would pill or not :(",3
긍정,"Thats really helpful, Thank you! I live in Australia so it gets really warm here too, sounds like that sheen is normal. I have a look at the powder.",1
긍정,I have heard good things about anessa. Do you find the anessa one leaves any white cast or changes your skin tone a bit?,2
중립,"I agree with this! Applying more of it though also leaves a bit of shine, which I powder down especially around the eyes. House of Hur weightless sun fluid is even more matte on me and I have combo skin. I’ve also heard the Numbuzin sunscreen is more matte but I have yet to try it. 

Just a note: my partner has tried Anessa and isn’t the biggest fan because it was a bit harder to blend into facial hair. He seems to have this ick about the texture for that reason with anything that’s a hybrid formula like Anessa or has powders in it. YMMV",1
부정,Glad I'm not the only one lol. I have oily skin so I think that contributes to it plus sometimes in the past I have used a moisturiser underneath my sunscreen which might have made it worst. I'll check out the HaruHaru rec,3
중립,Twin! I just pat any excess product off with a lint free tissue and then pat the boj sunstick,2
긍정,"Thats a good point haha, I have used the Skin1004 sunscreen before but it does get shiny. Is this the Dr G one that ur referring to? 

""Dr .G - Green Mild Up Sun+""",2

중립,"To my understanding, matte means that the finish looks more natural or sometimes slightly powdery and dewy means that it leaves a glowy/shiny finish, kind of like a moisturised or ""glass skin"" look.

From what the other people have said on this post so far, if you have oily skin and/or live in a warmer environment, that can contribute to the matte look looking more shiny as well.",3

중립,"I can’t imagine that sunscreen face would be a reason why anyone would look strangely at you here in Aus - everyone wears sunscreen all the time, as we should.",14
중립,"Most do. However, since you are in Australia, I find Mecca face sunscreen (the one in a tube) mattifies after. However, it's a small tube and it's a little tinted.

I also find that if I blend my sunscreen using the Naked Sunday sunscreen brush, it helps take away some of the sheen.",1
중립,"i have oily skin and anessa leaves me shiny still, but the sekkisei uv skincare milk leaves me actually matte (especially the latest 2025 formula). only thing is there’s a slight white cast now that didn’t use to be in the older formula. i’ve tried probably 30+ sunscreens",5
중립,There is a little bit of a white cast unfortunately :(,1
중립,"I’ve actually got pretty dry skin, so my routine’s super moisturising. If it’s your moisturiser causing issues, try waiting like 30 minutes (or even up to an hour) before putting on your SPF. It gives your skincare time to actually soak in before you add another layer on top.",2
중립,Yes! There is an initial white cast though,2
중립,"I don’t think there’s any white cast at all, it doesn’t even look like powder it just looks like bare skin without any shine. I have light-medium skin though so idk if there would be white cast on darker skin.",2

중립,"I'm in the Uk where Superdrug and Boots have started to sell more Korean products, but they are so much more expensive than from Yesstyle or Stylevana. For example my favourite sunscreen Haruharu wonder airy fit sunscreen is usually about £8 online, and about £18 in the shops.",37

긍정,"I feel the option with the acid peel + picolaser both in one session will surely show you the best result. Picolaser will do most of the work of getting rid of dark spots on the surface and AHA/BHA will help with skin turnover and pore clogging, so deeper spots will come to the surface faster. So if you do this set a few times, you can get rid of all the spots and prevent new ones from forming, and then you'll be done.


Also in between treatments, you can try azelaic acid and some AHA (not too strong) which helps with fading post inflammatory erythema/hyperpigmentation ie. the red and brown spots left after acne.",4
긍정,"speaking from experience with laser for acne scars on the face (pigmented and atrophic), i had undergone micro-needling and laser to lighten the appearance of them and resurface the skin. 

i would say that typically after your first session, you would expect to see the most drastic results and the subsequent sessions to seem to “slow in improvement” as the first session’s results are usually appear to improve drastically from the original state of the scars!

i would suggest you look into pie/pih combatting skincare to use on your back (if you’re not sensitive to it considering you have a history of eczema) to aid in lightening of the scars. i personally have traces of chicken pox scarring on my lower back and i religiously use skincare and i’ve had very good improvement since! niacinamide is really effective on my skin, alpha arbutin and l-ascorbic acid (most potent and effective form of vitamin c) as well",2

긍정,"Thank you very much! I’ll look into this 

Do you have any opinions whether chemical peels alone, picolaser as spot treatment only, peels and laser in one session OR peels then laser would better treat this? ",1
긍정,Thank you! Could you explain why chemical peel would be the best for now? Out of curiosity! ,1
중립,"Hey! So it's a relatively large skin area with an equal distribution of marks that need attention so it would be more efficient to simply get the chemical peel a few times which would considerably lighten and resolve most of the problems I assume.  Then for the darker/older patches that are left, you can get the laser treatment done. Chemical is less painful than the laser as well. ",1
중립,I would approach my face in the same way btw,1
긍정,"Thank you! Appreciate this. Do you think it’d be better to go with peel + laser all in one session VS the clinic offering peels for the first few sessions, then if that fails, laser? 

Also at one of these clinics, Picolaser is actually cheaper than the peels (which I know is unusual)! So I wonder if laser only might be an option to go with (if the peels and laser are similar efficacy?)",1
중립,"Honestly I'm not sure about peel and laser (if we're thinking of the same chemical peel. I know that there are several different concentrations). I'm not sure about getting them both at the same time (seems counterintuitive? You could ask why they'd recommend both)

Again, with the chemical peel, it's going to depend on the concentration. The one that I'm familiar with can go several layers deep (will turn area deeply red and eventually shed like a sunburn) but the pico is gentler and may require multiple passes to get the same result.",1

긍정,"I’ve tried all except the Dinto so can’t give my opinion on that. My fav from these are Laka, Heart Percent and Entropy! 

Heart Percent is so so lightweight, I absolutely love that but it is true that you need to apply 2-3 layers to match the swatches online and tbh it doesn’t last THAT long.
Laka has the strongest tint and it’s the most long lasting!
Entropy doesn’t leave that much of a tint IMO but it feels really nice to apply and it’s very glowy.
Peripera and Fwee are both too sticky for me and I hate the Fwee packaging. I do love Made It though, I have 3 of it just because the colour is so nice and it’s really really pigmented. I have to make sure I’m only applying a tiny bit and then I sheer it out. Just wish it wasn’t as sticky.. Both of these don’t tint the lips.",35
긍정,"Love laka and dinto! Imo dinto stains really nicely, and I like that both brands have a good range of winter cool toned/neutral shades instead of just bright reds/popsicle shades and pinks. Both are nice consistencies as well! My go to for laka are 123 and 120 and dinto's memento mori.",34
긍정,"I have the fwee glosses and laka tints! for fwee, I really like them - i personally dont find that they look uneven & i really like how they apply! theyre a bit heavier & slightly stickier than a normal lip gloss, but not uncomfortable & i find it makes them last longer on the lips!

for Laka, the colors definitely lean brighter/more saturated and dont really look like the official swatches online so if possible its best to swatch IRL! but i loveee the finish - its very comfortable and makes ur lips look so juicy! plus i find the tint lasts really long on the lips! its a really nice formula if you find a color that works for you 🤣",14
긍정,"I quite enjoyed the Laka. It's hydrating and long lasting, and leaves a nice stain. I absolutely hate it when I buy a lip tint and it looks good at first but the stain it leaves is ten shades brighter than the og colour; this one isn't like that at all.

I have shade 115 Envy and it looks great on me as a cool toned pale olive, not warm and not bright pink.",12
긍정,"I’ll be buried with Dinto Memento Mori (pun unintended but loved). Dinto products go on easily, are buildable, have minimal transfer, and stay put. One day last year, I fell asleep in my work makeup, including Dinto Memento Mori. I woke up with a still-flawless stain (credit to Dinto, my application skills are mediocre at best) that didn’t budge, but removed easily when I “scrubbed” my lips with my toothbrush. Plus, their glowy collection is inspired by Marcus Aurelius, which makes my Stoic heart soar. Love all around",13
중립,"Besides it being difficult to find an accurate shade swatch, I do really like the way Dinto looks on my lips. It’s my favourite formula to wear I’d say.",9
긍정,"I love Peripera Made It, and I think the oversized applicator is so cute! The shade is very suitable as my MLBB because my lips are paper white sometimes. Yes, it's quite sheer. It's not at all pink like your Custard Mauve as this leans brown (vs purple for Black Honey).

However, a bit sticky and big fat zero lasting power. So don't pick this one if you want something with a lasting stain.",10
긍정,"I have tried dinto, laka and the gloss from peripera. I think dinto has the best formula of the three, but the shades weren’t a hit for me. I found laka to be more drying than dinto, and the shades were much brighter on me than the official swatches. I love the peripera gloss, but it is sticky and has no staining power. Have heard really good things about fwee and that is on my wishlist. Would also like to recommend bbia glow tint which I like better in terms of color and formula than dinto and laka.",7
긍정,Laka!! I love it.,6
중립,i became a recent huge fan of laka’s tints!,6
중립,"It depends what you're looking for in a tint. I personally have lips with a lot of wrinkles and lightweight formulas doesn't work for me. I disliked Romand's Juicy lasting tint and I don't like Dinto's formula either. The only lightweight one I liked is Lilybyred's galssy layer tint. Dinto has gorgeous colors though and it tints pretty well too, it's a shame the formula is not richer. 

On the other hand, I loved Peripera ink mood glowy tints, Romand glassting gloss and like Peripera's gloss too. Thicker, juicy formulas make my lips look smoother, so I prefer them.

If you want something more lightweight but still nourishing you could try Maybelline's lifter balm. I'm leally enjoying #08. 

On the topic of sheerness: both Roman and Peripera glosses are quite sheer. I blur out my lipliners and even then you can still see them under the gloss, these glosses are that sheer.  If you like the sound of the formula and want more opaque color, try Periper ink mood glowy tints.",4
긍정,"you must try Daisique watery lip gloss if you haven’t! No artificial taste or smell, not at all sticky, great shade selection, glossy, nice applicator/packaging, everything you’d want :)",3
중립,Laka is womderful.,3
긍정,"Laka is amazing, I have it in several colors, Caffeine Rose is my favorite color. Great tint, very buildable, I love how it applies and how it sits on the lips. highly recommend this brand!

Heart Percent is also nice, I have the brownish one. Its is not very pigmented or dark, but it is a very nice product, feels great on the lips. The color doesn't last long though. More of a lip gloss maybe than a tint, I find that it doesn't stain.

I have one lip gloss from Fwee, in ""Scene Black"" and it is a waste of money, it is barely pigmented and mixes horribly with other products from other brands. I would not recommend this color, haven't tried other ones.",3
중립,"I can only comment on the 2 I’ve tried which are Fwee and Peripera. Peripera is much thicker in consistency and has a HUGE applicator so it picks up a lot of product. Fwee is thinner in consistency and a small applicator so I find it easier for application. I personally prefer the Fwee colours, they suit my summer mute colouring!",5
긍정,"I have bought 6 Dinto lip stains and they are amazing bc they last a long time and have a wide range of interesting shades, but the con is that they kind of stain the same reddish pink color on me 🥲 Their formula is amazing imo bc I can just put it on my dry a** lips and my lips immediately become moisturized",2
중립,"I must add one another vote for Lakka. This is my favorite tint brand so far, because of how bright and long lasting they are. I also noticed, that my lips more hydrated after them, but I have no idea why.",2
긍정,"Laka is the best, but the peripera made it gloss is such a nice shade to wear on top of tints to give it more dimension. i regularly pair the two together.

laka also recently released a gloss thats very nice as well and has more tint than the peripera one and more shine than their standards tints.",2
중립,"My experience with the Dinto is the tint had a very different color that the bulk gloss. When I put it on initially it was reddish brown, but in 30 min when bulk had worn off it was bluish red. (Can’t remember the color). I won’t buy another one, it was very incongruent color wise.",2
중립,Is it just me or peripera lip stain or glosses oxidize? Even if I put in the lightest shade after a hew hours all would change to red overtime 😭,2
중립,"I've tried Dinto, Laka and fwee.

Personally, I don't like the Laka tints - they do provide a lot of colour, but the tint layer feels very heavy for me. Dinto is much more comfortable, and doesn't flake on me like Laka tends to (very dry skin).
The fwee gloss is definitely on the heavier side, but I wouldn't call it sticky; I feel like it's more of a ""hydrating"" heaviness.",2
중립,"I adore the heart percent, fwee & peripera! I’m getting a bunch more come Black Friday; I’m also planning on trying Laka",2
중립,"I have the peripera gloss in a different shade. Can't say for the other ones you've listed here, but it's way more tacky/heavy/sticky on the lips compared to other lippies that I have. It was also constantly leaking unless I set it upright.",2
긍정,Love peripera,2
긍정,"I have the dinto and it's sooo good. Based on my experience, it doesn't sink into the lines of my lips it's hard to explain but basically it doesn't highlight the lines on my lips which makes it just so plump and juicy and once it sets IT'S TRANSFER-PROOF like even after a few kisses on the back of my hand neither the color or gloss comes off (but the gloss comes off after a while BUT TAKES A WHILE). 


If u wanna get the dinto, go for it it's very worth it and colors are pretty. Head's up though, the first initiaI color of the dinto is different to when it has dried down or has set on your lips, it gets slightly darker but it's not really a problem for me. Personally wanna get the laka on my next purchase they say the staining power is really good",2
중립,Made it! Peripera,2
긍정,"Have tried almost all of these so here is my take:
Laka - thinner formula, more of a proper lip tint with good staining. color is pretty strong so good for pigmented lips. i have the dark purple shade and it’s definitely cool and looks fairly similar to the swatches, but this might vary for lighter shades. has a strong-ish smell too
Entropy - i like this formula since it’s thicker but the application picks up too much product in my opinion, just makes it a bit messy to apply. also the lid is way heavier than the base so you have to be careful with how you store it. more of a gloss, doesn’t stain
Dinto - definitely agree that the swatches are a bit off, they aren’t as muted as shown. formula is fine, it’s also more of a lip tint formula. does stain, but harder to gauge since my shade is lighter 
Peripera - i have this exact shade and do like the color. it’s a lip gloss rather than tint, and i find it more moisturizing than the others in your list. it’s definitely decently thick/sticky, but you can apply it lighter if you use the back of the applicator rather than the front which has a dip to collect more product

my recommendation would be laka for lip tint and Peripera for lip gloss",2
중립,Art visage tint is my favourite colours 06 07,2
긍정,"I love Laka, it’s a very reliable lip tint and it wears so comfortably too",1
긍정,"I have only used the peripera in made it, it's a very thick formula which I love and I don't mind the stickiness. I really love this particular shade and for 4-5 dollars at a discount it is so worth it. For me the pigmentation was in the middle between sheer and opaque. I liked it so much that even with other lip products that I was using I finished it within 6 months by end of winter as it was very moisturising. If I get the chance will repurchase again for Christmas.",1
중립,"i'm a fan of both the dinto and laka lip tints. with the dinto tints, they are somewhat sheer so the natural color of your lips will affect the color - thus inconsistency with the official swatches. to combat this, I use a taupe lip liner all over my lips to neutralize everything before applying the lip tint. i found that the shade will match the official swatch this way!",1
중립,"TY. I also heard that Fwee packaging is quite hard to get the product. So maybe that one will not be my kind of product. 

Gosh. I might have to break my buy one rules. I really like that Peripera colour. I don't mind the stickiness or long lasting power as long as I can use it daily I'm oki with re-touch.",1
중립,Hello! thanks for sharing the texture for peripera and fwee. Could you also share your opinion on the texture for Laka's?,1
중립,"Ohh, I'm enjoying Laka 123 and 130 right now, might try Dinto Memento Mori!

긍정,"OH, I just check Laka tint has like 50 colour. That's wow. I'm torn between Dinto and Laka now. Maybe I will try a mini Laka first and if I can find the correct swatch for Dinto 219, I may buy that one. Lowkey in love with Laka for selling mini tint with all 50 shades",1

긍정,"i really, really dislike innisfree's rebrand. almost every products are in this white packaging with low contrast colored text to tell you the product line. it used to be that each product line has different colored packaging and it's much easier to spot that way. i can't wait for this whole beige minimalism trend to finally die for good",379
중립,I actually like Purito’s use of color.  What I can’t stand is what in the typography hell is going on with the product names on all of their packaging?!,184
중립,I think the old packaging is sort of cheap looking compared to the new one!! Other than the orange what do you dislike?,71
중립,"it’s petty and I’m not sure if it counts, but I’m irrationally mad about etude house changing to just ETUDE 👿",59
긍정,"Nope not an issue for me. If it’s a good product I’m going to buy it again. Unless the form of packaging didn’t work, like if they went from squeeze tube to pump bottle and it didn’t work for that particular product, but if it’s just a color change that isn’t an issue for me.",68
중립,I would just put it in a drawer so I don’t have to see it. That seems easier than finding a new sunscreen.,44
중립,"The only one I'm STILL bothered by is Etude House. I miss my cute packaging and long name. For Purito, I rather like it. I would be mad if Pyunkang Yul changed their packaging",20
부정,"Dr. Jart BB cream has been my HG for over a decade, and I’m ride or die. However, to your point, the first formula I used came in a metallic gold dispenser, and then matte black…and now their only BB cream formula comes in the grossest flesh tone. It’s not indicative of shade, it’s just…fleshy?? Hate it.

This one from Isntree. It looks like a water bottle 💀",14

But my style is to keep everything hidden away. And I don't mind the orange.",35
중립,Maybe pop a sleeve or washi tape over it?,17
중립,the im from new packaging rolling in? im sorry but the mugwort essence going from the most beautiful glass bottle to /that/?,7
긍정,"Sulwhasoo products - though I still use them, the rebranding and beige repackaging makes it looks like a trash Kardashian skincare brand. The packaging earlier really looked premium, and I have kept empty bottles because they looked so nice. Now I can't wait to throw the bottles away the moment the product is over.",6
중립,"Not really, unless the formula changes",5
중립,"I have the old packaging of this sunscreen and had no idea it changed. OMG it looks so different now, and somehow seems more American than Korean",5
중립,Missha rebranded their time revolution line🤢,3
중립,"Nope, I just care about any reformulation.",3
중립,"I'm ready to fight these CEO for what they are doing to my favorite brands T\_T someone just stoop them Innisfree, Sulwhasoo, The History of Whoo even Chogongjin ........",3
중립,"I like purito’s current packaging design haha. 

Honestly, unless it’s an issue with dispensing the product or shrinkflation idrc. I do like and pay attention to packaging design but I have picky problem skin so it’s absolutely not that important to me",2
중립,How’s this sunscreen to use in the summers when the UV index is high?,1
중립,Nope. Lol,1
중립,yes i miss the packaging being inspired by the botanical ingredients!,82
중립,Agree! Their old packaging looked much classier too. The new containers are still heavy glass but look like a cheap plastic.,49

중립,their packaging used to be so cute too :(,12
중립,It looks like store brand otc medications,11
중립,"Yes, their old packaging was super cute and made it easy to distinguish between the lines",7
중립,I got out of my k-beauty hobby for a few years bc depression and came back and didn't even recognize the new packaging! Legit thought they just shut down 😭,5
중립,"Same, I really liked the old packaging. I didn't repurchase anything after my bottles ran out.",3
중립,wait omg they used to be so cute :( i never used the older ones so i didn’t know,1
부정,"As a few others pointed out, I typography is pretty awful, and while I like when companies use color in their packaging, this neon orange color just looks like a generic sport sunscreen. I think the older packaging just better represented the ""soft touch"" naming :(",12
중립,While we're at it can we talk about how their packaging used to be so cute and princessy and now it's just generic minimalist brand number 69420,36
중립,"omg glad to see I'm not the only one lol...I get that they're trying to seem more contemporary or something, but etude house had so much more charm",19
중립,No they didn’t! 😱 Etude House is such an iconic brand! Why are they shortening and sans-serifing everything? 😫,3
중립,"yes!! i was so confused when i was looking around for Etude House to return to the Double Lasting foundation after being tired of trying new stuff that didnt work as well as that one, but all i could find was ""Etude""?! i thought it was a scam at first! 😭

they rebranded in 2016, apparently, but i only found out around 2024 😅 i miss the whimsy 😮‍💨",3
중립,Me toooo and it’s harder to google it now!!!,1
중립,"I have larger concerns than ugly packaging or scents I don’t like. But skincare also isn’t some therapeutic self-care thing I do, it’s what I slap on my face before I sleep and when I get ready for the day.",13
긍정,"Yeah it's really not a HUGE issue for me, I'm so happy to have finally found something that works that I typically buy them in bulk. I think the irresponsible voice in my head just convinces me that theres a product out there that works just as well *and* is cuter to look at.",1
중립,"I would, but I disinfect my skincare bottles often, so leaving them on the counter makes it easier",-4
긍정,"I would be very disappointed in Pyunkang Yul changed their packaging. The color containers & simple labels are a nice touch, they’re very classy next to the tub of Cetaphil",4
부정,"I don’t mind the pinky beige color since I find it cute, but I hate that it’s not in a squeezable tube! There’ll be so much wasted product since I won’t be able to squeeze it out or cut the tube.",2
중립,"Haha I don't know, I actually prefer the sweet cute pig over the angry devil pig on some of their other packaging! 😂",14
중립,"lol I feel like all it needs is giant ""WATER"" text on the label to make it look like the generic bottles they use in tv shows.",2
중립,This. I would not care if my sunscreen came in bedazzled bucket with a lid. I’m not looking for a new sunscreen.,16
중립,What a cute idea!,6
중립,I think I just realized why the neon orange bothers me so much!! It's the same orange that Banana Boat and a ton of generic US sunscreens use 💀,1

긍정,"I like “I’m from pear” and round lab dokdo toner pads. Also love the corsx light propolis toner pads. 

My only problem with toner pads is that I have to use them as the first step or else the pad will remove the layers below. 

Oh, the Mary and may glutathione pads are also very nice, but boy are they heavily fragranced.",1
중립,"Since I'm assuming Australia, I think Fancy Life also usually  has them (although sometimes a bit more  expensive?) if there is a store nearby, otherwise they should be relatively accessible online!",2
중립,I find toner pads *way* more hydrating than using a toner on a cotton pad and using my hands 🙌🏼. The toner pads tend to be saturated with product. That is the case for the ones I’ve used anyway.,1
중립,Here's my obligatory rec for the isntree yam root milk cleanser (what a shocker /s). Creamy and soft while being very gentle. Can't say it lathers well though. It more melts than lathers,4
중립,d’Alba White Truffle Return Oil Cream Cleanser.,1
중립,I know what you mean... there’s something satisfying about a cleanser with a rich texture. I really like creamy gel formulas that foam just a bit but don’t strip. The Japanese ones tend to nail that balance; look for ones labeled “moist” or “mild whip” and you’ll probably find that plush feel you’re after.,1
중립,"When you say you want a cleanser with a thick texture I imagine a cleanser like the Skin1004 Ampoule foam or Round Lab Dokdo cleanser or Mugwort cleanser. These textures are thick and creamy. Realistically I don't think thick textures are compatible with a pump since it will likely be too thick to travel through the pump.

Gel and milky cleansers are typically stored in pump bottles since the texture is watery and loose so it can travel through the pump easily.",1
중립,Forever this cleanser!!!!!,1

중립,"Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil. 

I've been repurchasing this for several years now and it still works beautifully. I sometimes look at other makeup removers and cleansers, and toy with the idea of testing them out, then shrug it off and keep going with my tried and true product that I know will get the job done.

But I noticed that I tend to rotate face wash depending on my needs. I have combination skin and sulwhsoo is my daily. But there are times my face gets more dry so I switch to something more gentle (non-AB). I also use the Hera melanotoning face wash. 

If you use a lot of makeup, cleanit balm is great for getting everything off.",1

중립,it wont let me add my ig and it's driving me nuts,1
긍정,"I’ve had good luck focusing on hydration layers instead of chasing one “miracle” product. Things like peptide serums and rich but non-greasy creams make a big difference when your skin barrier’s happy. Also, sleeping masks a few times a week keep everything plump and smooth without overdoing it.",23
긍정,"- SPF SPF SPF SPF SPF. SPF > any skincare on the market. Make sure you wear a hat or use a parasol if it’s really sunny. Your sunscreen is your last line of defence in the sun. Don’t bother with stick or spray, get a good old liquid sunscreen and slap a good amount on your face. The best sunscreen is whatever you love enough to use consistently so find a brand that you really really like. I have been using Anessa Perfect Milk for 10+ years. 

- Vitamin C. Use whatever concentration your skin will tolerate, my skin is sensitive and I can’t use anything stronger than the Rohto Melano Premium Essence atm. 

- Skin usually gets dryer as you age so look into deep moisturizing products if you notice your skin drying out. Wrinkles are more obvious on dehydrated skin. I’m currently using the TIRTIR ceramic ampoule and moisturizer. 

- 

Lastly nothing beats not smoking and drinking, getting tons water, eating and sleeping well, and eat collagen if you can (bone broth or pork skin or whatever). You cant out moisturise a poor lifestyle 🤪",35
긍정,"for fine lines/sleep lines, i focus on prevention: i sleep in [these](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA250933698) or similar a couple times a week and they really help with preventing fine lines in the morning from sleep. they're pricey though so sometimes i just use [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SWPBJ52?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1) overnight (or i just try to sleep on my back lol but i always turn over onto my side or stomach eventually!).

in terms of essences/lotions, i find keeping my moisture barrier intact and keeping my skin very moisturized has been huge for making my skin appear firmer and with fewer lines.

* any moisturizer with 5% urea is extremely, extremely loved by my skin, which is very dry and prone to irritation. the zeroid 5% urea cream is my holy grail, but also annoyingly expensive.
* i also really enjoy torriden's DIVE IN toner pads & their ceramide lotion (i can't recall the name but it's the one in the yellow bottle).
* abib collagen masks are amazing! i have tried a bunch of milky sheet masks since i got a huge haul when i was in seoul last month and have been really impressed by these

and it goes without saying: SUNSCREEN! sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen! make sure to reapply especially if you're outside or by a sunny window!

긍정,"I totally get wanting something specific, but honestly it depends on your skin type. If you’re combo or normal, something with peptides and ceramides is a great place to start. If you’re on the drier side, look for a thicker cream with squalane or shea butter. The key is to keep your skin barrier strong first, everything else works better after that.",2

i don't use any topical collagen, so i figured i'll cut down on trying out new skincare stuff and focus on something that can really make a difference instead. i also always believe that supplements > topical products.

긍정,"I think Ratzilla is just translating what’s included in the Japanese marketing copy so if it’s not mentioned she won’t include it in the table.

Japanese sunscreens tend to value being cosmetically elegant above anything else so they aren’t usually the best for rigorous outdoor sports. The best sports one I’ve tried so far is Biore Athlizm but I just wear it to the gym. I’d still rely on a proper sports oriented one that’s rated for water resistance if I ever want to spend extended amount of time outdoors and will be swimming or sweating a lot.

If I’m wearing makeup and spending some time  outdoors (eg: wedding, hanging out with friends at a cafe patio) I use Anessa. It really works so well under makeup 🥲",6

I sleep with a long silk bonnet and it does a great job of preserving the curl pattern.

I find that the care in the first week matters the most. After that, the curl is basically set - it may get gradually looser over time, but the wave shape is set, if that makes any sense. So in the first week I really baby my hair: go as long as possible without shampooing, and when I do shampoo, be very gentle to try not to disrupt the curls; use a long bonnet and try not to toss and turn too much.",5

Sometimes the reaction is a sign of a compromised barrier. 

Also, it really depends a lot on the products you are using. If you are using products with lots of active and functional ingredients or botanicals or essential oils, the problem could be that. Tiny whiteheads on the cheeks and temples sounds like a reaction to a fragrant ingredient. Butylene glycol is ubiquitous, so you may conclude it is the culprit. But it could very well be something else. Essential oils and fragrances cause tiny whiteheads, and so can epidermal growth factors. 

I’d be interested in seeing your routine/ products. It just may not be the butylene glycol.",9

I do like using:
- Mediheal pads
- Haru Haru black rice toner

And I only use Korean or Japanese facial sunscreens. Those are by far the most superior and much cheaper. I'll never give up my Asian sunscreens. 

One of my closest friends used to work in the skincare industry and was actually one of the first beauty bloggers to discover Beauty of Joseon and write about it. We have many discussions about skincare products. I have been given a giant bag of samples of skincare products from another friend and tried many, many brands - Asian and Western. My friends and I have a group chat for skincare and we're constantly sharing information on things we're trying. 

However, being Canadian sometimes the effort to get Korean products is too much of a hassle for the possibility the product breaks me out. It's time consuming to check ingredients and also take a risk on things that won't work.

But the level of nuance displayed in your response exceeds the statement that you “can’t use a lot of Korean products.” The Korean skincare industry is not only massive but also influential and leads the way in skincare innovations, which your “fellow countrymen” benefit from in many ways. You absolutely *could* use a lot of Korean skincare products because a great many differ very little from products from in Canada. But you choose not to do so for certain practical reasons. 

Your nationalistic fervor seems rather tone deaf on a subreddit dedicated to Asian beauty. And because your last paragraph subtly implies that research is a key element in Canadian skincare, I want to underscore that Korean beauty products are also grounded in research and scientific studies, which are often overlooked by western-centric scholars—until they are needed to justify duplicating korean formulations in western nations.

I am trying to imagine going over to the Canadian skincare subreddit and saying “I can’t use a lot of Canadian skincare because it breaks me out,” and I cannot. It seems both provocative and dismissive.",5

To me, it’s about layering humectants early in the routine, adding ferments, and sealing them in with a moisturizer. My skincare routine sort of builds up to a glow.

I'm planning to start a new skincare routine since what I have now doesn't seem to be working anymore. I have oily skin and live in a hot, humid climate. From what I read in the discussions here, it's best to introduce new products one by one to figure out which one is incompatible and all. 

My first concern is how to go about this new routine. I may be overthinking it but do I continue using the old products minus one that's being replaced with something new first, try it out for 2-4 weeks to see what happens? And repeat the process for every new product? Or do I stop using everything from the old routine and introduce new products in the same timespan but this would end up with me not having much of a routine if I only use 1 new product for every new month.

Lastly, what products should I prioritize changing first? I think the water-based cleanser is the first but not sure what else follows. Asking this because I'd like to buy the absolute essentials first.

중립,"Strictly speaking, this sunscreen is chemical. 

Unfortunately, it contains the UV filter Tinsorb M (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol). 

That UV filter comes in the form of a stark white insoluble powder, so it's just as bad as mineral UV filters on darker skin tones. Some people even consider it to be a ""hybrid filter"" for that reason. 

I'm also black, and I always advise people to look out for the specific problematic ingredients in products you're interested in rather than ask about white cast. Lots of people will just make a judgment call regarding white cast on their own skin, but by knowing the ingredients you can consistently avoid having issues. 

My personal favorite currently is the Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh Sunscreen. Pretty much perfectly fits all of your criteria. I also love the Missha All Around Safe Block Sun Essence SPF 45.

I strongly prefer people with a science based approach. No ""clean beauty,"" no DIY, and little to no trend chasing. Ads are fine as long as they're upfront and properly disclosed. 

My favorite is Dr Michelle Wong, aka LabMuffin Beauty Science. But another amazing cosmetic chemist, especially for any skin tone related info, is Esther Olu, themelaninchemist on Instagram. 

Nowadays, there are quite a few black beauty professionals out there testing SPF for white cast, texture, finish, etc., but once I knew what to look out for, I didn't really find it necessary to follow anyone else's advice. I also live in Asia, so it's easy for me to try AB products.",3

중립,"It depends on your skin type around the eyes. For me,  using thick eye creams gives milia. So I usually apply whatever serums I use and then tap the face moisturizer which is left on my fingertips after applying it on face and neck.


As for my mom, she slathers the thick eye creams without any issue. But she doesn't like serums around the eye area. She says those irritate her eyelids after awhile.


So just follow whatever works for you. At the end of the day, your eye area needs some sort of moisture. I guess it doesn't matter which one you use.",21

Overall my collagen is still good and I have super thick skin with plenty of subcutaneous fat so there’s plenty of padding from underneath and my skin isn’t particularly saggy or loose.

I also think have oily skin and oily-as-heck eyelids helps with the non-wrinkling.

These days I just dab extra moisturizer under the eye. My eyebrows also tend to get a bit dry in the winter so I’ll apply moisturizer around the bone.

Overall it’s my cheeks that tend to get dry so if I slather anything on (sometimes I mix moisturizers to accommodate for my combo t-zone) I just bring it up all the way to my bottom eyelid.  Generally for the eye area because of my oiliness I prefer serums and lighter moisturizers, layered, not thick occlusives, especially at night.

긍정,"I first want to start my review by saying that I feel like some of these blushes were unnecessary/not-worth purchases. Mainly the Dior and Clinique blush. I also listed a decent amount of Western blushes because I have either seen a lot of Korean MUAs/makeup shops carry them, or because I think the shade would be very popular if sold in Korea.

I've seen a lot of complaints about the Dior blush having 0 pigment, but I think it's due to consumers trying to swatch in-store using their finger. It did take a lot of digging in my pan to produce this finger swatch, but a low-density brush picks up the pigment 100x better. That said, I feel like this blush got duped by 10 other brands and there's just way better formulations for a similar pricepoint, like Gucci, Armani, YSL, or Patrick Ta. It's not blurring at all like the other blushes in the list, it's just a wash of color that doesn't do much for my complexion and it's almost too dark for a blue-pink, at least for my liking.

I love the Clinique blush, but it's not worth the pain in the ass it takes to get it shipped from Korea at a markup. The color is super pretty, but damn is it hard to build up any noticeable pigment. It has very subtle pearls in the formula, which the other powder blushes in this post do not. It adds a slight shininess to the cheeks without it looking like glitter. I've been using it for about a year now and hit pan, but also, I've been using it very sparingly because I just really hate having things shipped from overseas. Plus, I feel like the two shades above it (Rom&nd and Dasique) are lowkey dupes for it when applied to the cheeks. Also, while I didn't swatch them today, I have the Melon & Pansy pop shades. If anyone is curious, I will answer in a further comment but this review is already long enough on it's own.

I have conflicting thoughts about both of the Rom&nd blushes. The ""deeper"" one (it's not deep at all), Blueberry Chip, is the perfect daily shade for me--it's a perfect mute/neutral pink that doesn't look like skin irritation--and I don't need to use much of it. I see a lot of Korean MUAs/YouTubers use the Strawberry one as a ""blush base"" and while I do notice a slight improvement in blending and saturation when doing that, the blush is SO POWDERY that it's just annoying to use. It flies everywhere. And while it blends very smoothly, I hate the fallout and mess it makes in the pan if you're rushing in the mornings like I am. If I had to describe the texture of this blush, it'd be like flour or powdered sugar--very fluffy.

The Dasique blushes feel like ""watered down"" versions of the Rom&nd blushes. Less pigmentation, but also less fallout. It feels more chalky than it does powdery. I need to build it up a lot with the brush. But I do find myself reaching for the coral shade a lot as it's very fluorescent and makes my blush stand out (without looking garish/clown-y). It's a good product for the price, and as a very pale person I'm not concerned with the lack of pigment that those with deeper skin tones might find an issue with.

Finally, the Patrick Ta blushes have to be my current favorite. No fallout and very buildable. I am yet to try the ""cream-over-powder"" technique that Patrick Ta recommends because that has not consistently worked for my other cream blushes including Dior and Armani; it's a hit-or-miss technique. I noticed for the ""She's That Girl"" shade, however, the cream is very obviously cool-leaning while the powder is extremely warm so I kinda feel like I threw half of my money away--but I like the formulation and color of the cream so much that I'm fine with that. It also reminds me of AOU's blush in the Peony shade, but that's just me imagining things--if someone has it, feel free to comment a picture of it lol. I like the ""Just Enough"" duo for super cool-toned makeup looks, where I might even pop on a little bit of my purple Clinique blush.

I hope this post helps at least one person. Let me know if you have any questions and I'm happy to answer!",9
중립,WOWOW!! Patrick ones are niceee and pigmented,2

i'm a hugeeeeee fan of clinique blushes and i've decided to only purchase clinique blushes from now on. i have plum, fig, and cola but i'm thinking of something more pale and want to look into melon or pansy if it's cool tone

the last blush i purchased was visee foggy cheeks which is very easy to pick up and quite pigmented for jbeauty. i love it as a close second but my heart is with clinique",1
중립,"Yeah, I had to dig into them the least when producing swatches. The Korean blushes, while I like using daily, were very hard to make an even swatch that showed the pigment",2
중립,"LOL yeah, it's pigmented but it's so similar in brightness to my skin. Strawberry milk is the one I hit pan on, yes. For me, when I put it on, it just looks like I used a pink filter on my skin if that makes sense? There's no difference in shade, literally just a cool pink hue. The image in cool lighting shows the effect better",1
중립,"Pansy pop is the like the Dasique Bubble Coral but a little deeper and way more saturated. I use bubble coral if I don't want a heavy cheek, and melon pop if I need a pop of color. If you use plum, fig, and cola, then melon pop will definitely be the pale shade you're looking for. But it's more neutral or spring.

For cool tone, I recommend heather or pink pop as I've swatched them in store before. Pansy pop is PURPLE-PURPLE. I see most Korean MUAs/influencers using it like a ""blush topper"" to shift the tone of any blush they already applied, or very lightly and sheered out to create a wash of super cool-toned pink. If you're pale, this blush will definitely last a long time as a little goes a long way",1

긍정,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have **light medium, warm leaning olive skin**, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

https://preview.redd.it/xkd6qzilvpyf1.jpeg?width=3972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=113842cc80be66f72248c41df367b561cb0f29d9

Here’s **my experience with the blush shades** I have:

1. Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2. Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3. Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4. Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too *ashy*, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5. Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

**Some lip shades I have:**

* Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1. Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2. Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3. Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4. Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5. Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.

Anyway, my **ideal** lip color is one that’s as close to my **natural lip color** as possible and lines up the best with my **skin tone**. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (**peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink**).

The main struggle I’m having is **finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.**

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing **matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product** that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too! Thanks :) 🙏",2

중립,"Their clean ingredients and focus on ‘healthy’ skin, is what sells their products. In my opinion that is. I purchase my hydration and sun care needs from there and medical grade needs from here 😃",3
중립,I find Korean/Japanese skincare focuses more on natural ingredients which is surprisingly better than European ones which emphasize on “high” concentrations of active I ingredients (which you probably won’t need or could even worsen your skin condition). Even those who were using high end European skincare have shifted to Asian skincare nowadays. No wonder why Korean old ladies skin don’t age lol.,2

긍정,"I live somewhere very humid and hot in the summer, cold and dry in the winter. I also have combo, sensitive skin. 

I found swapping out my toner and moisturizer works best for me. I’ll use a watery toner for the warmer months (usually Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioner), then switch to a thicker, more viscous toner in the colder months (Rohto Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion). Same goes for my moisturizer.

I moved from South Florida to Northern California and my skin is shriveling up at the climate difference in addition to the weather change🤣

In FL it was always humid and my skin was always oily at the end of the day. I only used mediheal tea tree toner pads + tony moly mochi water cream (and occasionally vanicream in the tub if it's a drier day).  Now I'm suddenly wondering where all that oil went 😭

I haven't added that many new products in the drier climate since I didn't want to break out, but I'm still using the tony moly mochi water cream and still using toner pads but with the [wet dressing method ](https://www.everydayhealth.com/eczema/can-wet-wrap-therapy-help-severe-eczema-flares/)where I put a barrier cream on the skin before slapping the toner pads on and it's been working great.

Personally I don't slug in summer time, I slug some of my face in the fall and all of my face in the winter time! Everything else is pretty much the same.

I have dry skin, and in winter adding a heavier overnight mask a few nights a week has made a huge difference. I can't recommend the Abib probiotics overnight barrier jelly enough (just be warned that it is quite sticky, so I do my skincare at least an hour before bed).  I use a watery toner and milky toner year round, but in winter change to a heavier cream than I use in the summer at night. I also switch my sunscreen to a thicker one (I really like the Haruharu sunscreen in the mustard coloured tube for winter). A liberal application of lip mask overnight also helps a lot, and I reapply lip balm throught the day.",1

My eczema requires a solid body care routine, so I usually layer or swap my body moisturizers (non-AB gentle body creams) into my face routine as needed. I also slug my face and body year round, again as needed. I recently bought ilyoon ceramide cream, so I'm looking forward to testing it once it gets cooler (right now it's still fairly warm). I also stick to my more moisturizing sunscreens like cosrx aloe sun cream when it's cooler.",1

중립,"my skin type is dehydrated-oily, and I do swap some stuff.

I add an extra layer of lotion-type essence after my usual toner/essence. I swap my HA serums to thicker ones like the Decorte liposome. I add a more occlusive type of cream with ceramides to my daily lightweight cream moisturiser to prevent water loss. I use less actives as my skin surface will get really dry, and I bring around a travel sized bi-phase for the day.",1

중립,"Hi, which heavier cream do you use in winters?",1
중립,"Yep. In 45C 80% Relative Humidity I’ll use 1/2 a pea size of Aestura cream in the AM, on a damp face, over a couple of drops of hydrating toner/serum. That’s more than enough. In the 0C 15-20% RH, 1.5 - 2 pea size, over 3-4 drops of humectant. It’s the same thing, and does what I need it to, but I can still have that single product stretch across seasons. Nothing unpredictable happens, it just takes a little trial and error.",1

I think the Illiyoon cream is probably the thickest I've tried and will be good for really cold days, but I currently only use it when I'm feeling extra dry or sensitive. The Soon Jung 2x Barrier cream was ok for me, but not my favorite (it's on the thinner side). Last winter I tried the Round Lab Soybean cream and a non-ab cream (Biossance squalane), which were nice, but I didn't love them and won't be repurchasing; I found them both a bit greasy feeling. I actually really liked the Mary&May blackberry cream and might go back to that after the ones I have lined up to try this winter, if I don't like them better. The Abib barrier jelly has honestly been fantastic for me in dry central air, so I think the combo of that with the Mary&May cream might be perfect.

Irrational reason: I won’t use makeup products that have two shades mixed in one component such as marbled eyeshadows or those swirled lip glosses.

i recently realised i'm allergic to 1,2-hexanediol which is basically in every korean product nowadays. my skin is especially reactive when 1,2-hexanediol is in watery porudcts, there are some creams and thicker serums/toner i have been using for a while and that contain 1,2-hexanediol. i've never had issues with those. this is good for my wallet because i can't try out as much but also kind of sad because i also have a bunch of other allergies so there really isn't a lot of skincare left that i can use.",28

How did it happen? Well Bioderma micellar water was recommended to me by everyone, and it seemed like a nice thing for those days that I am too sick to cleanse my face properly (I was in a dire medical situation at the time) since everyone said it doesn't have to be rinsed off. So one day I tried it, removed what was left of my eye makeup and put an occlusive cream over my face. **THEN IT STARTED BURNING LIKE HELL!!!** I sprinted to my bathroom and washed my face with water.


When I inspected the eye area that burned I saw a burn 1cm*1cm on my under eye area with spots that were brown (some are still brown after two years but much less noticeable maybe because of retinal).



I don't know what I did wrong but the fact that that could happen makes me not want to purchase such products ever again, since I am kinda traumatised. It was a real product as well, bought from a city pharmacy.",5

Big shocker since I bought it to fix my barrier. 

Big shocker overall about the trapping too much hydration too, which in retrospect, I’ve experienced a few times, once when I mixed too much pure glycerin with my moisturizer then slugged it. So no allergic dermatitis, necessarily! At least I’m personally educated in wrecking your barrier doing too little and too much! Now I’m wary of too much of that glazed donut feeling. At some point I lost touch and forgot my skin was still supposed to feel like skin, albeit nicer skin.",3

중립,"Mine was more like a false alarm but I thought it’d be funny to share. 

I’ve been using the Curel powder in balm intensive moisture care tube religiously ever since my stress-induced hormonal imbalance flare ups, which caused my face to suddenly become the richest oil well ever that even the Saudi Arabians would be jealous of. 😂 I also was diagnosed with Type 2 rosacea, and breakouts aside my face would ITCH whenever anything came into contact with it. Hence this balm — god it was a holy grail.

So I’ve been using the same tube for 4-5 months, and I have a very peculiar habit of trying to squeeze everything out beyond its lifetime because a “dime is a dime”, and towards the end the balm has become so powdery, crumbly, and hard to spread out. I was convinced it was the weather, or that it was my isotret working way too well, anything but the product.

On the inside I was squirming because I didn’t want to declare my newfound holy grail dead. I literally told my mom I was gonna give it a proper funeral if I had to declare it dead. That’s how (pre-emptively) heartbroken I was. 

Then I bought a new tube and cracked it open. Back to the spreadable, soothing and actually occlusive yet moisturizing balm ever.

I went ahead and bought yet another tube for my dorm nights. 😂",2

중립,"I think I have an issue with this or butylene glycol. And not always. Just have often experienced products with these ingredients not fully drying/leaving this film feeling and then my face eventually gets irritated from too much dampness so I don’t know that it’s necessarily an allergy/sensitivity or the mechanism. Because I’ve had the same experience mixing too much glycerin in my moisturizer before too, then slugging over it with oil. And I’m fine with all of that in reasonable amounts. The over hydration irritation I get is this redness, itchiness, and tiny pustules that do not look like acne. And it always takes a few days of subjecting it to the glazed donut treatment before it starts creeping up, first with the mildest itch. 

Have had this with Korean sunscreens and also ampoules/serums (wrote about it happening with Iunik beta glucan elsewhere in this thread). No problems with my beloved Zeroid moisturizers though 1,2-hexanediol is not as high in the ingredients there. Maybe it’s also about how one usually uses less moisturizer vs other skincare products.

긍정,"Ooo you’ve got some good stuff, there!  I’ve used the Purito Mighty Bamboo Panthenol Cream before and it’s a nice, lightweight gel-cream barrier cream!  It’s a little too “glass skin” in finish for me—it is a Korean product after all, but I tend to go for Japanese products that aim for a more natural “mochi skin” finish instead—however, for a barrier cream that’s lightweight and unobtrusive, it’s great!  I also recently purchased the Dokdo cleanser!  It’s definitely a gentle cleanser, AND you get a lot in the tube, so it’ll last a while!",9

중립,Pls tell me about the house of hur weightless sunscreen,1
중립,I like it a lot! It doesn't sting or burn my skin even with twice daily use (which I only tried a couple of times). It's not as thick as the ordinary one which I looove (that one was so annoying to apply and it burned my skin eventho it was 10%). I use it along with my Anua Azelaic 10%. Both together have been helping keeping my redness at bay.,7

중립,hi! wondering whats the texture of kisocare azelaic 20% like? im currently using skinoren but i feel that it's a little bit greasy,1
중립,does kisocare help with hyperpigmentation?,1
긍정,"Hiya!  Happy to share, friendo!

I like the Naturie Hatomugi products a lot!  I have the Skin Conditioner and the Skin Conditioning Gel.  I’ve never tried the Skin Conditioning Milk, but I hear it’s like an emulsion in consistency if you need extra moisture!

I also really like Hada Labo!  I have the Shirojyun Premium Lotion (blue bottle) for brightening, and the Gokujyun Premium Lotion (gold bottle) for added moisture, but the gold one also helps with brightening because it has seven types of hyaluronic acid inside, and hyaluronic acid has wound healing properties.  Plus I have the Hada Labo Perfect Gel!  I will say the Gokujyun Premium Lotion and the Perfect Gel can seem sticky when you apply them—the trick is to work them into your skin past the “this feels sticky” phase.  You may need to clean your hands off and then pat the products in some more to ensure they get absorbed properly!

The first time I used each of these Japanese products after the Korean products I’d tried previously had left me looking too shiny—especially the moisturizers—I was like “Oh yeah.  MUCH better.”

I hope some (or all) of these will work for you!

I will say I do still love Korean sheet masks for the extra moisture boost!  Torriden Dive In sheet masks and Round Lab Dokdo sheet masks are the best!",1
중립,Yes! Asian Beauty items are reformulated very often as well as being flat out discontinued . Thanks for understanding lol. The solidarity is tea.,6

중립,Which one do you like better Kisocare or Cos De Baha?,4
중립,very interested in your reviews of both,2
중립,"You know, I don’t know for sure. It seems to help a bit. It definitely helps with soothing redness and it feels absolutely lovely going on.",1
중립,"The essence sounds promising, thanks!",1
긍정,"It’s a cream, but definitely not greasy. And it comes out thin which is nice if you’re spot treating.",1
긍정,"It’s so hard to pick! I have so many PDRN serums and many that I haven’t even opened yet. I’ve been trying to finish the Medicube pink serum (I have the salmon pdrn version) and it’s so nice! It has a bunch of peptides including copper peptide. The only thing I feel iffy that disodium edta (it’s above the pdrn which is added at 1%) is so up on the list so I’m not going to use the other bottles I have once I finish this one. 
I’m really excited to use the Kisocare Milt PDRN serum which has 12% of salmon pdrn! 

I don’t recommend the VT pdrn essence cuz they say it has a high percentage of pdrn complex but the actual pdrn is extremely low. 

I also really enjoy the heveblue ampoule, it has pdrn + salmon egg extract!",2

긍정,Thank you!,1
긍정,"I think they're great for lazy mornings and for people who struggle with having any kind of skincare routine, looking for a one-step product. But cleansers are more economical and thorough imo. I will never stop recommending the isntree yam root milk cleanser for anyone looking for something very gentle ",10
중립,I have combo skin and during the winter my skin is prone to be more dry around the t-zone area. I don’t feel like I need to cleanse with soap in the mornings (unless I feel like it. I use cleansing water instead. I use the one from Torriden. It cleanses well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated from the HA in it. They also have it as a pad too!,3
중립,"I do this frequently when my skin doesn’t feel super oily in the mornings (like fall, winter). I typically DIY my own with my toner and a cotton pad and have never had problems with this causing breakouts. I just go with what my skin tells me it needs that day.",4
중립,"actually people are not replacing anything, they are just not cleasing at AM anymore, even dermatologists reccomend it.",5
긍정,"When I have toner pads, I do this. My skin is pretty dry and cleansing it in the morning every day would wreck havoc on my barrier. Additionally, I've lived in places where the water is really not good so using the toner pads to wipe off any sweat is a much safer bet. Tbh I think it's the same as rinsing your face with only water in the morning - it's just meant to get sweat from sleep off, which is only  what a lot of dry skin people like me need. ",2
중립,"Personally I wouldn’t do this, because I just wouldn’t feel like my skin is clean if I skip the actual cleansing step. But then again, I use exclusively balms for cleansing, so I have no concerns of dryness or messing up my barrier, which is why people might be doing this (unless they’re just being lazy, haha, which is valid!)",1
중립,"I use the Celimax One Step Mild Cleansing Pads to remove my makeup at night and sometimes instead of cleansing in the morning, they’re so hydrating and never sting my skin even after exfoliating with AHA/BHA/adapalene",1
중립,"I’ve been using kbeauty for like a decade now, I’ve tried the whole not cleansing my face in the morning because of this subreddit but it’s just not for me haha Like I tried just toner, just micellar water, rinsing off, my skin wasn’t a fan",1
중립,"I don’t cleanse at all in the morning. I just rinse with water and do my skincare. 

I do however, do a thorough cleanse at night.",1
중립,I have heard of this. And no I would not do it. I believe in doing a morning cleanse with a gentle cleanser. I think people are trying to find a thousand ways to avoid morning cleansings instead of just trying mild cleansers.,1
긍정,i'm in need of a gentle cleanser so i'll be adding this to my black friday list! thank you for the rec!,2
중립,Is the Isntree Yam root milk cleanser a 1st or 2nd step ? Or do you use it alone ?,1
긍정,Oh my god I have this in my Black Friday cart! It's so great to hear from someone that's used it!!,2
중립,This.,1
중립,"Well, no, not in the cases I’ve seen because she (and he) said “this is what I use for my morning cleanser” and then used another toner or two after. I’m sure that’s case in plenty of situations but the people I’ve seen doing this all say it’s their way of cleansing/washing. It’s mostly with an exfoliant. I have in the past just rinsed and went on my merry way with steps though!",1
긍정,Oh and gentle cleanser recs- Make Prem Safe Me line is super good.,1
중립,Can I ask you something about kbeauty since you’re experienced? Do all your products have niacinamide?,1
중립,I use it as a second cleanser. It's definitely not enough as a first step to take makeup and sunscreen off,3
중립,It won't disappoint!,2
중립,Dont get too hung up on the wording they are using. Using an exfoliating pad isn’t “cleansing”. They skipped cleansing and went straight to exfoliating no matter what words they use. I personally just rinse with water in the morning and carry on with the rest of my skincare routine,5
중립,Nope,1
중립,"Then it's a solid option for me for winter ! I don't wear make-up, and go without sunscreen most of the time in winter. I know it's blasphemy lol, but I work 12h shifts and don't see the sun all day in my work days as it's down before/after work here in winter. I also don't use harsh actives in my routine, it's mostly hydration and barrier consolidation oriented. 

I currently use the Skin1004 cleansing oil and ampoule foam and this has greatly improved my acne-prone skin, but I might give the Yam root milk cleanser a try as my combo skin tends to be dehydrated and tight in winter...",2
중립,[deleted],51
부정,"I feel you. 

I'm also in Europe, and two of my orders were charged customs fees. Yesstyle refunds it in the form of credit, which is just so frustrating because that's not REALLY a refund. It obviously causes us to buy more.

On one of their sales, they marked some items I wanted as in stock -- turns out, they were never in stock, they were actually completely discontinued by the manufacturer. But I'd added other items to get free shipping, and they wouldn't let me cancel them. What a waste of packaging and fuel. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't an accident.

And then all the delays too, like yours.

I've used up my refund credit now, and going to stick to other sites because I'm so pissed at their business practices. Stylevana is often cheaper. Also Notino and Makeup",102
중립,I never have this problem with yeststyle but with Stylevana . Ordered from them last week of August and finally my order arrived this week. Also always try to order stuff that is in stock to be posted in 24 hrs. Had to go to boots to restock spf in the meantime,46
부정,"Crap. One of my orders says it was shipped on the 18th, but I've had no tracking updates since then (says ""Shipping label created, USPS awaiting item""), so I emailed them last night, and am yet to receive a response. How frustrating!

Edit: Am in the US.",10
긍정,"If you're in the UK, skinsider is great. Interestingly, iherb is extremely fast too and reasonably priced.",9
중립,It's so weird bc this has happened to me twice now ordering from Europe. When I lived in Canada and the US I never had this issue with Yesstyle. Maybe an EU thing?,24
부정,They had my package delivered by a really shitty carrier (Apple Express) who delivered to a completely different address with photographic proof that its the wrong address. They’ve basically told me I’m shit out of luck because it says it’s been delivered and the carrier ghosted me and won’t do anything either. I would hate to do a chargeback on my credit card because I know I won’t be able to order from there ever again but it’s so ridiculous to deny me a refund when the proof of delivery is very clearly not my house.,4
긍정,"It is seriously worth it to order from Olive Young for anything you need and you don’t have a back up

I keep my eyes open for their sales and coupons, which tend to be good. They also do a lot of 1+1s or other bonus items",19
중립,"I ordered from the EU as well, I had a few of those products that take 3 weeks to ship and it did take exactly 3 weeks but after that it arrived in less than a week, I guess it depends on the situation.",7
중립,"I’m sorry — I was just about to place an order with them because Stylevana doesn’t have the products I’m looking for, and their prices seem lower. Now I’m having second thoughts about ordering since I know they’ve had issues with deliveries, which is why I was thinking of making a small, low-cost order — one that I wouldn’t regret if it never arrived.",3
긍정,"How strange, so sorry that happened to you. Personally I always had a good experience with them but, I do the opposite of you, which is I always AVOID the products that ""ship within 21 days"" because it takes so long and sometimes they can be actually out of stock (happened to me once). So except if I really want one of those items, they are the ones I usually avoid.",3
중립,I've ordered from YS and Stylevna multiple times and no issues.,5
중립,"I ordered from yesstyle and stylevana at the same time and the yesstyle package has yet to move and the stylevana one is almost here. Despite seeing more of yesstyle on my particular algorithm, and occasionally ordering, I keep having a better time elsewhere",2
긍정,"I literally just had a bad experience with them, too! I was wondering if anyone's experience had changed recently! I was only on my second order with them. 

My situation: items that said they'd be with them in 7-14 days weren't there after 14 days. I then had to contact them to discuss it even though not getting something within an advertised timeframe is obviously an issue on the sellers end. They then said I could keep waiting (but that they had no idea when they'd get those products) or refund the non-supplied items and ship the rest. I left extra days, just to see if they'd end up eventually getting the things. They didn't, and I then sent an email on October 29, asking whether, instead of what they suggested, I could just substitute/add other products I wanted that cost more, obviously at my additional cost. Given what a saga it was turning out to be, when they didn't reply promptly to the email, I ended up contacting them again through the chat feature to get that clarification, feeling like enough time had already been wasted (the answer was no!) I then opted that day to just have the rest shipped. They then sat on the order for several days after that, which I thought was kind of wild after everything else! Ultimately, I put in the order on October 11 and it was only shipped yesterday.

I didn't really have issues with the other order I made before this, but couldn't believe how convoluted this became. Because it took so long, I ended up having to locally buy another serum and lotion at our wack Australian prices because I'd been waiting so long for the stuff in the order to get to me that I was running low on what I use, and genuinely had no idea when I'd ever see the Yesstyle products because of how annoying this whole timeline was. I also so agree about the annoyance of getting their marketing emails while going ""Yeah, okay...but where's the stuff I already ordered, damn it?!"" I also think it's not good policy for unsupplied product refunds to be automatically given as store credit and only provided as a genuine refund if a customer takes an extra step, when this is specifically happening in the context of a business not supplying items it said it could. Like, I didn't change my mind about the products. The shop changed its ability to supply items. Why do customers then need to opt-in to a bona fide refund that potentially takes 30 days? 

I know it's skin products and I don't have some emergency need for them, but some of this just isn't good business practice and I don't feel like it's that hard to realise that this would be annoying to customers. Maybe the business just has so much money and so many customers that they don't really care about bothering some, though - especially due to how competitive their prices are and how massive the range is.",2
중립,"I’m from Eastern Europe and I’ve never had issues with Yesstyle, been ordering since 2019 every 2-3 months. Got hit by customs once in 2020 but they refunded it fully. Never got hit by customs again. Order always arrives on time - by DPD within 2-3 weeks. But reading this makes me a bit worried…",2
중립,"This is why i’m still hesitant in hitting that place order button in yesstyle.
Patience is not my virtue, and if I ever experience that “credit refund” thing, i’d lose it for being screwed over-twice.",2
중립,I have the same problem and I am in Europe. So frustrating.,3
중립,"Im in Australia, dont have any issues.",3
중립,Probably an EU thing! I’m in Canada and made 2 orders recently- one arrived in 2 weeks and the other in 9 days.,3
중립,They forgot one of my products and it was hell to get it back 😭 They gave me the wrong tracking number and all,1
중립,Well we are having a same experience. I have been waiting for it for 2months and contacted their live agents and email nothing was helpful. They didn’t tell me the truth and I requested to get a refund and they refused. I ordered $250 worth products and still have no refund or products. I will never ever order products from Yesstyle again.,1
중립,+1. They are not legit,1
중립,Why not order from olive young? I did YesStyle twice never again. The shipping and waiting isn’t worth it,0
중립,"So I’m in the US, and I ordered something 5 weeks ago and it still has yet to arrive! Very pissed off, and will not be ordering from them again either…",1
중립,"This would imply that the customer data bank of yesstyle had been leaked, which isn't the case. Otherwise, more people would.complain. your credit card info was probably attained by hacking into accounts of yours. Do you use the same e-mail address and password on different websites?

중립,"I'm in the US, but I will always use Stylevana! They don't charge tariffs and there are no brokerage fees when delivering to the US.",6
중립,"All of this. And the fact that they say things will be shipped within 24 hours, but at most they create the shipping label within that time fram (if even), and then it just sits there for days or weeks on end.",20
중립,"I hope you get your package soon! I also made an order on the 18th (I'm assuming this month, of  October?) and I just got my package yesterday  (live in Texas). Mine was shipped through Uniuni and there wasn't *any* updates for tracking until a couple days ago.",3
중립,I think it’s happening all around. I am in US and waiting for my package for 2 months still nothing.,1
중립,Just do a credit card charge back and then create a new account,1
중립,"I enjoy olive young more since their shipping is faster. They sell most if not all the K-beauty products I like using anyways. While yesstyle was cheaper, the trade off is their slow shipping unless you buy enough to get free express shipping.",4
부정,I have been waiting for my package for 2 months. Still have nothing delivered. I sent them email and connected to a live agents and I asked for refund since I haven’t received my package for 2months. The worst part is they did not even offer me credit refund! I think they are having problem for shipping since August.,1
긍정,I’m happy to read this. I’m Aussie too and shop there when I can’t find it here in Aus. But haven’t shopped on YesStyle for a year or more.,2
부정,"Nah, just bad luck I think :( 

I have ordered from both stylevana and yesstyle (actually twice from latter one in last months due to sales) to Germany, which is notorious for finicky customs and had zero issues, stuff always arrived within 3 weeks or less.",5
중립,"if op is european, buying from oliveyoung means paying basically guaranteed customs.",28
중립,Some of us use Japanese products.  Doubt they are available at Olive Young.,15
중립,"Olive Young is really expensive in my experience, especially if you're looking to try stuff out and can't take advantage of bulk discounts. And IIRC they ship DHL, at least to Canada, which practically guarantees duties with exorbitant processing fees.",14
부정,"My data has not been leaked. I came to the conclusion it maybe had something to do with how the payment is being transferred/routed in EU/Asia. The first charge was in Hong Kong and instantly after that in Estonia. In addition there was a third attempt at a charge, after which my bank flagged it and automatically cancelled my card and the payments. (Sorry for the confusing explanation, English is not my first or second language and I’m not sure if I’m using the correct terms.) Anyhow, I contacted Yesstyle instantly after this and they never got back to me, and this whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth. There’s never been any issues like this with Stylevana. E: I’m really strict with data security and never reuse passwords, and I often check if my info has been compromised",1
중립,Omg! I JUST got an update that my package has finally reached the US! PHEW!,4
중립,Wouldn’t my credit card be flagged in their system?,1
부정,Ah sorry had no idea. Is it a lot? I used to pay around $15 for my orders which are usually between $200-250. I may be bad at conversion lol.,1
긍정,"Have you tried Amazon Japan? I’m in the US but did an Amazon JP haul over the summer and had a good experience. Products were much cheaper but shipping was more so it worked out to be about the same cost as Yes Style. They had some newer products I had never seen on YS plus I was able to get some other non-skin care stuff. I’m sure this varies by country, but for that US (at least in July) they included duties and tariffs at checkout and prepaid them.",5
긍정,"That’s the problem I have, my HG sunscreen is Skin Aqua, which is Japanese, and YesStyle always has it. But I’m in the U.S. so sometimes I order from senti senti dot com, which supports a minority-woman-owned small business in NYC, so I feel good about that. Prices are usually a little higher than YesStyle but they ship immediately, often the same day I place my order.",6
중립,"I wanna try Japanese skincare so bad but my experience with yes style wasn’t great so I’ll just make do with StyleKorean but now I see that it’s very expensive to deliver to some countries which I had no idea about.

Edit: olive young. Not StyleKorean. I used to use style Korean before I discovered olive young.",1
중립,"I can tell you it's very unlikely that the payment service provider has a security issue. Otherwise, other credit card customers would have been affected too. Someone got hold of your credit card info because you've used it either in a shop where employees have stolen your data, via social engineering, a compromised payment device or hacked into one of your shop accounts where you saved all your credit card info. 

It is very unlikely that yesstyle is the offender. 

I can only advise you to use a service that hides your credit card info, like paypal, install 2FA and be very vigilant on where you use your card. Get a cyber insurance that covers any possible damages, use strong passwords and e-mail alias",1
긍정,"That's great news for you! I'm based in the US also and this is my first time using YesStyle.

중립,"Skin type: VERY DRY

Weather: colder and drier currently

Review: Beauty of Joseon rice and probiotics sunscreen. This sunscreen is my holy grail because I've finally found one which moisturizes me enough. This glides on like butter and is so soft and smooth. This, however, is not water and sweat resistant so you might wanna reapply but other than that the texture is like whipped cream. One thing that I've noticed is that it also calms down the skin because the ingredients are barrier repairing as well. Redness calms down. For me, it definitely sinks in, very hydrating and moisturizimg, plus it gives that radiance and luminosity that is just chef's kiss. Reapplication is smooth too. It has no fragrance. I wish this sunscreen was a moisturizer, like same ingredients, same texture for my PM skincare routine. Not to sound dramatic but I can't imagine my life without it.",97

Hi! So i have acne prone skin (or had?? As i was on accutane and the acne completely went away, didnt have a single breakout since then) but i had some bumps which felt like just congestion deep inside my skin. I never used anything special for my skincare, just salicylic acid facewash and moisturizer + spf. My skin is on the drier+dehydrated side but my nose can get oily. It has been 2 years since i got done with accutane.

So i started using this serum around 3 weeks ago (nights) along with the centella tone brightening ampule (morning). My moisturizer & facewash are the same.  I started getting smallll breakouts (some are pus filled, some become whiteheads) around my mouth (the congestion usually was around my mouth. if i sort of stretched the skin u could see it, but in the daylight) since a couple of days ago. 

Could this be purging? Im kind of terrified because i had acne most of my life and accutane saved me. Im so scared of having it again ... i hope this IS purging and not acne making a comeback... i dont think there was this much congestion around my mouth??",1

Skin Type: Normally combo/normal but drier recently due to tretinoin use 

Country/Climate: UK Cold and Dry

Top Skin Concern: Patches of texture on my right cheek, faint fine line on forehead

Current Routine/Products I am Using:
Actives: Tretinoin Cream, Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads (contain PHA/LHA)
Hydrating/Soothing: Centella Hydrating Mist Spray, Centella Hyaluronic Acid
Barrier Support: Laneige Water Bank Moisturiser, Purito Barrier Cream

AM Routine: (The routine I'm currently following)
1.  Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads 
2.  Laneige Vitamin C 
3.  Centella Hyaluronic Acid
4.  Centella Hydrating Mist Spray
5.  Laneige Moisturiser 
6.  BOJ Sunscreen

PM Routine: (I am alternating actives with rest days to avoid irritation)

Tretinoin Nights (Mon/Fri): Cleanse > Tretinoin > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Glycolic Nights (Wed): Cleanse > Numbuzin Pads > Glycolic Acid > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Rest/Repair Nights: Cleanse > Centella Mist > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream 


I'm looking for feedback on whether the alternating PM routine is safe and effective for treating the texture while managing the dryness. I also am suspicious that the Purito cream may be making my face sting a little but am not sure if it’s due to the cream or overdoing my actives.

The issue with most tints is they're actually brighter than this shade (which I love) e.g. things like lilybryred Blackberry Tequila or 3CE ""Spiced Up"" in Lazy Pop Stain. I have a million plum vamps, and 332 K-Tints but we're not on speaking terms atm (Bright. Bright little girl colours I just can't).

Girlcult J808 and Dinto 216 ""Umbra"" are pretty much bang on to the Uhue U05 Like amazing close. Dinto you will need to layer to get the pigment.

Uhue MIrror Lipstick in G625. That's a more purple vamp than brown red, but it's a gorgeous vamp and it's still got that shine and sheerness if you want the comfort and a bit more ""soft goth""

Uhue Gloss in U06 is a similar tone, it's just much more sheer, a bit lighter and a bit less vamp and has glitter in it. That is actually still available through ""LookHealthyStore"". I've bought through them (Chinese) b4. Hyntoor's OG old Whimsical Planet Watery Lip Gloss in 002. Probably skip it tho, too sheer. Couldn't find it.

""Romantic Goth""? I'm old and goth goth, but I'm trying to think outside the box:

Pinate Bare Glow Peptide Melting Balm in ""Sequence"". It's similar to Uhue U06 it's sort of sheer plummy but with gorgeous glitter. It's ""classy sheer vamp"".  
Into You Glowing Lipstick in ML07 (Mauve) -  this is so classy and muted purple. It's romantic. I love it.  
Derol (YesStyle) Sugar Candy Glossy Balm ""Dominant"" is a deep vamp burgundy, Messy and all other shades are not nice but it's so cheap.  
Shellwe Makeup x Freya86 Punk Bunny Collection Gloss. It is beautiful. didn't swatch 'cos I knew it was a deep cool-tone but check it out. It's a lovely vamp and could be worn more sheer, too.  
Fenty Gloss Stix in ""Black'r Berry - she deep vamp tho, but you could sheer it out.  
Girlcult obvs. Sheered out, J809 and J816 might work in Lip Glaze, they're pretty deep though FYI, L06 Nightfeast (sheered out also) could look sort of ""classy goth"", but again that's a very deep brownish vamp like the others, I think the Mirror Glaze J7X's might be too gothy. J808 is a huge contender tho, just remember it tastes like roses.  
Rom&nd Deep Sangria JLT if you can still get it. It's not this but it's vampy/soft goth. Plum Coke if you don't mind a bit brighter. The black tint is back in the mini TJLT now (some of the mini Glasting Glosses are fun colours/colour changers)  
Heart Percent Dote On Mood Top Coating Lip Plumper in Mood Changer is a deep plum, so cool-toned, but could be handy to just mute and vamp down some of your existing collection.  
Don't overlook Revlon or L'Oreal on this.

More Goth Goth:

Hyntoor released some new shades recently, including a more trad red in their lip mud (B02 ""Carrie"") but not so close to this, it's more of a cool-tone or neutral-red, plus a black mirror gloss squeeeeeeee). Also look at their Dark Style Reverse Macaroon Lip Muds and the Subversive Series in their lip muds.  
Kaleidos lip muds, not shine, but they have several gorgeous brown red shades e.g. Cognac and Bloodstone, check out their other vamp reds like Rubino or Smeared Rouge, they're cooler-toned tho  
DRAMO Moonlight in the Bottle Lip Mud Series  
CARMELA Renaissance and Waste Soil Collection Lip Mud Series  
Girl's Crush (Red Thorn and Black Rivet are lovely)  
Parper Lab have some rad lip muds/liquid lips (black, white, vamp)  
Other than that it's Western indie for me so I'll leave it there.",36

긍정,"Hiya. Me again (sorry mods I didn't realise I couldn't give other Western recs in one post).

So, I've just been thinking today that you might be after that picture's colour (which is stunning) and not what the actual Uhue gloss looks like IRL, it does tend to come off deeper which is why Gircult J808 and Dinto 261 Umbra (I think I kept reversing my numbers on that) are decent matches. You could sheer it right out I guess but to get that nice shine I need to pile it on. 

So, I can't give you my Western rec I found but I was making room for my new Rom&nd releases and I thought I'd just show you these two from Rom&nd (3 technically but that was a play around). If you want a deeper vamp or brickish red, then Zero Velvets got you covered, but I think these, especially the gloss might be a vibe for you.

Rom&nd Glasting Gloss 18 Red Bean Sirutteok. It's a mini, it's not on YS or OY yet, it's on Beauty Box Korea and a few eBay sellers I use sometimes so that's a pain but it's gorge. You need to layer to get anything like Uhue pigment (and I think you'll still fall short) and it's a bit of a different finish, but I just feel like it's such an elegant soft of ""soft"" classy vamp-lite. Bit of red, bit of plum, bit of brown.

The second is good old Rom&nd Glasting Water Tint in 17 Woody Sunset. I feel like this is going to be a little too bright overall, though depends on your lip pigment, maybe a bit too like, brown as well...but I also wonder what mixing in some of the other reds would do. 

I swatched Milk Tea Velvet Tint 2 in ""Black Tea"" sheered right out (that's quite browny plum, but sheers out to more of a vamp plum, not on par with what you're after but it's pretty and I was just playing. Earl Grey nice too). The others at the back too bright.

중립,StyleKorean is legitimate and does not sell fake products.,5
중립,I used to order a lot from them before recent events in the US and me going on a low-buy because I'm satisfied with my collection of products currently. I've never had a problem with them and they were my go-to K-beauty shop outside of ordering from Olive Young.,1
중립,"Ugh seriously fuck this shit! 

I remember back when you had to pay a bollocks Royal Mail £8 “handling fee” on top of the 20% VAT of nearly every single minuscule order that was valued at over £30 (can’t recall the exact figure but something like that) from outside the EU. 

If we have to go back to this nonsense then I really hope they just take the tax out at checkout instead of holding your package ransom and then charging you almost a tenner to deliver it like they were supposed to in the first place and acting like they’re doing you a blood favour. 

When is bullshit rule supposed come into place from anyway? I was planning on treating myself with 11:11 and Black Friday sales coming up and I don’t want to get any nasty unexpected surprises. ",36
중립,"We gotta stop copying the US for goddamn everything! 

What companies will do is declare less value of each item you order, that’s what everyone does when shipping fashion SAMPLES 

Stylevana already does something weird where they don’t ship directly to you but to a 3rd party company in the UK that then ships to you, so you won’t get import fees yourself but they might raise the prices from the start?",15
중립,"Any goods valued £15+ can be charged 20% VAT. If it’s a gift then it’s £39.99+.

Then if the package is valued £135+ it is liable to VAT and Customs Duty, which varies depending on the type of goods in the package. 

As far as I know YesStyle prices include the VAT. I placed an order and it was below £135 so didn’t qualify for customs. But It states on YesStyle’s website that if we get charged fees they will reimburse us with credit. 
And when I contacted Stylevana for my first order they told me they’d reimburse me if I got any charges for the package. 

Ultimately, I’m not sure it’s going to change much from a business perspective. Perhaps slight price increases?",6
중립,"The UK saw what the U.S. did and learned the wrong lesson. Seriously, it’s an absolute mess over here, what is UK thinking.",7
중립,">Like… if we order a cleanser from hong kong or korea that’s worth £20, will customs/vat fees start being added on top once it gets to the uk?

Yes. An import duty of *up to* 25%. There is the chance there could be a higher fee imposed on orders over 135 gbp to bring it in line.

>Just curious if anyone understands what this change would mean, will prices go up? Or is it more of a “wait and see” situation?

Prices won't necessarily go up at point of sale, you'll just have to account for paying DLD/Royal Mail before it can be delivered. I used to order from S Korea years ago and had to pay import duties at the sorting office before I could receive my delivery, although its probably all online now. Its really not a big change at all.",6

중립,The second one is sweat and humidity proof.,26
중립,"As per the website - 

Specifically designed for extreme climate conditions. Engineered to withstand high temperatures (40°C) and humidity (75%), this advanced sunscreen ensures long-lasting, durable protection against intense sun exposure.

Powered by Exclusive Tough Boost Technology, it provides friction resistance, maintaining its protective layer even with sweat, wiping, and clothing contact. Its very water-resistant formula offers up to 80 minutes of protection, making it ideal for outdoor activities.

Enriched with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, butylene glycol, and eucalyptus extract, it helps maintain skin moisture, preventing dryness caused by prolonged sun exposure. Additionally, it is non-comedogenic and dermatologically tested, making it suitable for daily wear.

Dang. Now I want to try it too 😂",14
중립,"I've actually always wondered the same thing but never made an effort to look into it lol so I also wanna know. 

BUT! I've used the normal version before and it's not very durable, meaning I sweat it off pretty easily since I live in a humid climate and I'm combo oily. I remember I actually got more tan while I was using this haha. It seems to work well for people who live in less humid/colder climates though! 

From the picture it looks like the extreme protection could be more sweat-proof. Dang, now I kinda wanna try the extreme version 😅",27

Definitely not the case for me though.

And I was just running errands, not hiking up a mountain or lounging sexily by the pool or anything. I felt so betrayed I never tried the Biore essence ever again. 😭

긍정,"I can definitely recommend shiseido for their makeup! The revitalessence skin glow foundation and the synchro skin self refreshing foundation are wonderful foundations!

D program by Shiseido is my favorite skincare brand and it’s worked wonders for my skin. It’s mainly formulated for sensitive skin so there are no fragrances :)",51
긍정,"Certain products are worth it, to me, but I am an older woman (46) with a good amount of disposable income. I don't really have to budget/save up for skincare so I've tried a few mid to higher end products, both western and Asian brands.

Cons are they are usually fragranced, pros are more elegant formulations, advanced delivery systems and higher amounts of beneficial ingredients meaning they feel good on my skin, absorb better and deliver what they need to in a way that makes a difference to me.

Note that my routine isn't exclusively ""luxe"", I use them with more reasonably priced products. And just because they are luxe doesn't mean they would work better for everyone - case in point my favourite cleansing balm remains the BoJ cleansing balm. I prefer it to all others I have tried including Elemis (which was waxy and left a residue - ugh).

AB mid to luxury products that are staples in my routine:
- Sulwhasoo FCAS - for the glow. Works best paired with another first essence, used to be SK-II but I'm trying it out with Missha FTE to see if it works just as well.
- Sulwhasoo Ginseng cream, both classic and rich. My skin loves ginseng and this packs a punch - softening, smoothing, firming. I gave a sample of this to my 71 year old mum who was never into skincare and she now loves it as much as I do, I buy her a couple of tubs a year.
- SK-II cleansing oil - this alongside Fancl is my favourite. Skin feels so soft afterwards.
- su:m37 micro active powder wash - I use this a few times a week, particularly after makeup. Wonderful cleanser and I think a little bit exfoliating (which is why I can't use it too frequently)
- Whoo Bichup - great serum, skin softening and smoothing. I use this at night as it's too rich for my morning routine
- Sooryehan The Black Serum - same effects as Bichup but lighter consistency. The first time I used it I couldn't stop touching my face, it felt lovely and smooth.
- Amorepacific Vintage Single Extract Essence - a wonderful first essence. This one is in my evening routine, gives me a dose of antioxidants and also has a smoothing effect.",47

중립,"They're only worth it if it doesn't hurt to buy them. If you barely notice the extra, and you can still maintain a routine that suits you, splurge away.

If you would have to scrimp or sacrifice--no, not worth it. At that point, you're better off building a maximalist routine with less expensive products.",53
긍정,"For SKII, I love the facial treatment essence, skin power advanced cream, and sheet masks.

For Shiseido I love the eye cream.

For Cle de Peau, I love the UV protective cream. It’s super expensive as a sunscreen but it does triple duty for me as makeup primer and daytime moisturiser as well. I live in a humid climate though so if you’re somewhere dry this probably isn’t enough as a daytime moisturiser.",11
긍정,"They are if you can afford it! I personally love the SK-II Pitera Essence and don't really believe in 'dupes', especially when it comes to fermented ingredients. Of course, if you find a cheaper product works the same or better for you, then by all means. But I do think there is something to be said about the research, development, and experience of certain luxury products.",16
중립,"Sulwhasoo is definitely effective. It's just expensive, so I don't buy it often. If I had more money, I'd switch all my products to Sulwhasoo or Whoo. My mom gets this cosmetic gift once a year for the holidays, a set of skin care products, lotion, and serum.",9
중립,"SKII facial treatment essence is one of my HGs. I truly didn't know I needed this product until I did. I've tried dupes of this product, even more expensive ones on the market, but genuinely, nothing comes close to this. 

The price tag kills me, of course, HAHA, but I cannot get enough of the benefits. I especially notice how weird my skin gets when I don't use it, so there ya go!",6
긍정,"There are some amazing products that are absolutely worth the price tag, and there are flops, just like Western luxury brands. I *do* think that online discussions of Asian beauty focus too heavily on drugstore products, such as Hada Labo, Canmake, etc.,--this isn't a problem per se (it's great if those products work for you, especially in this economy), but it's like limiting yourself to brands like NYX and Wet n Wild in non-AB. Unfortunately, a lot of midrange/luxury AB products are not very accessible overseas, which means a lot of people don't discuss them because they are simply not aware of them.

  
Personally, I don't use Korean luxury brands because I don't vibe with their traditional aesthetics (my mum and grandma love them, though...), but I love Japanese department store brands. They have more interesting but still very wearable and stylish shades compared to drugstore brands when it comes to makeup products, plus some great foundations and primers. I also enjoy luxury skincare but do note that a lot (most?) of them contain fragrance. Some of my favorite brands are: Shu Uemura (their legendary cleansing oil), IPSA (toners), Cosme Decorte (sunscreen, liposome skincare line), Celvoke (their makeup line in general, cleansing oil, facial oil), Addiction Tokyo (makeup), THREE (makeup). I also recently got deluxe samples of Pola/BA's toners and cream, which are amazing. The weather's getting dry where I live, and they hydrate my skin perfectly. I want to get the full size products so badly, but the price makes me cry.",17
중립,"Is sekkisei considered luxury or midrange? Their packaging has a premium feel but distribution wise you can find them in 7-11 or next to sk-II counters in departments store. I think it was one of the few brands where I managed to complete a full size of lotion, but I always forget they exist.",5
긍정,"I don’t usually use luxury skincare. I’ve tried Sulwahsoo and none of their products really did anything for me. Their FCAS broke me out somehow.

I do adore SKII, though. The FTE and the masks. I swear they really help—I did masks each day for three days before my wedding and my face was glowing. I’ve tried the Missha dupe and it did improve my skin tone and evenness compared to using nothing, but it wasn’t quite as good.",4
중립,"Luxury skincare definitely isn't necessary because there are so many affordable brands, however there are some items that I think are worth the money.

As i've moved into my 30s i've started exploring luxury skincare and there are hits and misses of course. Lux products are usually formulated for an older demographic which has both its pros and cons. (Pros: cosmetic elegance, packaging, lots of R&D around products/ingredients, they don't discontinue products easily. Cons: heavily fragraced, products are heavier and can be worse for acne prone skin, don't follow skincare trends as closely)

I think if you have the disposable income, its fun to try some luxury products. I would recommend getting sample packs before buying anything full size, and also wait for sales. Sales on lux products can be a bit more rare, but i never pay full price for lux products!

Lux products worth the money to me:
- Sulwhasoo overnight vitalizing mask
- Sulwhasoo ginseng eye cream
- Sulwhasoo FCAS
- Donginbi ginseng daily defense setum
- Donginbi ginseng daily defense cream


             
Lux products not worth the money:
- SKII (did not work for my skin)
- Donginbi Ginseng Moisture & Firming Softener
- Biodance collagen masks (not technically lux but expensive)
- Sulwhasoo cleansing foam and oil",3

중립,"For me, they are worth it now that I'm getting older. I swear by The History of Whoo and know their different lines quite well. I use different lines for the different seasons as they are quite extreme (I live in Switzerland; Summers are hot and the sun quite aggressive, winters are extremely dry and harsh, during spring and autumn the weather is all over the place...).
I had to try out new brands in my 30s, because my previous products slowly stopped doing their magic. 
The different lines of The Whoo cater to different skin needs and age ranges. The line for the young women is quite affordable I daresay.",3
중립,"Sk-ii FTE is my skin lifesaver. I don’t do skincare in teen and 20s, but I would use this on and off when i was younger whenever my skin got irritated or after i got sun burn and this soothes my skin like magic. Now as i’m doing skincare, i use this every day as my night routine and this is one product i would always buy and use",3
긍정,"Short answer is no. I don't think you need to buy ultra luxury to achieve the best skin you can have. I think a moderately priced lines are usually most cost effective. The increase in the benefit is not directly proportional with the increase in price. 

My take is buy what works for you and save the $$$ for cosmetic procedures. 

Long answer is it depends. 

If you are 30 something with decent skin, $575 Cle de Peau La Creme is not going to give you 10 times visible result than $40 Aestura cream. Your skin might look a little plumper, glowier but it's not going to be night and day. 

I have no problem buying expensive foundation if it gives me the coverage and finish I want. In my experience, the luxury brand tends to have foundation with better textures, less clogging, more color range and better packaging. As for  point makeup, I don't think my make up look that much different using $20 pallette vs $100+ pallette. 

For skincare, the uber expensive ones are lovely, feel more luxurious and smell a lot better, but they still don't erase fine lines or discoloration for me. 

Some expensive one, like SKII essence, gave me breakout. 

I now pick the skincare based on the actives- what I need. My routine is a mix of cheap, moderate, kinda pricey and prescription, but not super super expensive products.",4
긍정,"I do use a luxury priced brand but only purchase during sales/hot deals since the brand has that every month. I absolutely love their products especially the vita ampoule from Lavien but it’s crazy expensive rtp while they do deals with bundles and cost 40% cheaper or something..I also love Pink Wonder but it’s so pricey if you don’t purchase during a good sale. For korean brands, I tend to purchase directly from the brand or cjonstyle where there are sales going on or use a buy for me agent etc to forward to me.

I do think some of the pricier products are worth it but not all. I’ve tried a few vitamin c serums and Lavien is the only one that has worked for me.",2
긍정,"I like shiseido’s sunscreen in the white bottle where it adds abit of tone up  and sits well under my foundation base

Then I got their blue one shortly before their reformation. Tried both formulations for the blue one. I’m not a fan on how it sits under my foundation (Shu Uemura) so I just use concealer to cover my bags.

Compared to Anessa or Biore water gel grip and Suncut. I felt it’s way better as it doesn’t make my makeup look patchy/peeling like a lizards 


Shu Uemura (advanced) unlimited foundation

For context I live in a climate that’s hot and humid and I have combination skin (though it’s not as oily as when I was a teen)

I need a foundation that can last in a hot and humid climate.

I bought my first bottle in 2023 after getting swatched and asked for a sample to take home and tried it out. My then best friend said it looked very good after a long day of wearing it, so I got it after I considered my preferred options. The bottle lasted me over a year of wearing it

Got my second bottle in 2024 from cosme in Tokyo. Then they had the tsuya version of it and was contemplating getting it. Still stuck to the OG

Got my third bottle last week at their store in Daimaru, Sapporo (colder climate) after the reformulation (advanced). Had the same dilemma picking the matte one or the Tsuya one asked my sis to help me decide which looks better after getting swatched by the MUA. 

Stuck with the matte one considering I’m from a hot country

I haven’t tried it yet as I haven’t finished using my second bottle


Shu Uemura cleaning oil
Ngl one of the best cleansing oil. I’ve used 3 variations so far. The green, ultim8, black

Got my first full sized anti pollution (green) (450ml) at steal during warehouse sale where it’s like $150 usual price but I got it at $96. The bottle lasted me a year and a half.

I got ultim8 as a travel sized sample, works pretty good as well, makes my skin legit feel moisturized.

Currently I’m using the black one (pores), I say it’s alright just the texture of the oil is watery compared to the green and ultim8. No decrease in QOL so far

Also using their eyelash curler rn, goated for getting my lashes up but sometimes never curl everything and it’s hard to find pad replacements, stuck with the dupe pads. Saw their newer version of the eyelash curler named W which apparently more effective curling Asian lashes up.",2

RMK first sense hydrating lotion is an excellent lightweight hydrating lotion to use right after cleansing and before serum. RMK isn’t as expensive as other upscale Japanese brands but their skincare is great. I have used their hydrating oil and advance cream, which are great for dry skin. 

Sulwhasoo ginseng cream is fabulous. Just a tiny amount needed to keep the skin well moisturized. I bought two jars in Seoul duty free airport store bcs they were 30% less than in the city AND the sales staff threw in a generous kit of another Sulwhasoo brands line I can’t remember. One jar lasts 1.5 months.

중립,depends what you want out of it. Most of the time you’re paying for the experience more than the formula. But Sulwhasoo’s ginseng line? That stuff actually feels worth it.,2
긍정,"imo any luxury brand is for people who can afford them and for people who want to feel like they can afford them. people can swear up and down that it's the best thing ever, changed their life, etc... it's up to you to decide if that is worth the price tag. to me, it is mostly just a status symbol and i don't find it to be worth it but i also don't make like, a ton of money, so I'm sure others will have a different opinion / experience. 

 i have tried a cream from la mer and a toner (?) from sk II and found it just fine. i have not tried a lot of luxury skincare products, i have tried some luxury beauty products, and somewhat related, my mom owns a lot of luxury handbags. i don't find them any of them to be worth the money.

And omg, I also re-tested (like a sample tester kinda thing) for estee lauder night repair serum and I have been reminded of how much I used to love that (used a bottle or 2 in the past).

Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to tell how MUCH they worked ‘cause clearly, your girl didn’t have much disposable money then to keep using for years so I did not continue using them.

긍정,"Even dermatologists (or at least the ones I follow) say that the minimal skincare routine is just a starting point and that you should add additional products if necessary to meet your skin's needs. So for me, thats where I start. My skin needed tret for acne. Which meant that it needed way more hydration bc of the tret. So I had to add products to address that. Finally found the balance and now my skin is happy and so am I.

In terms of choosing products, I look for those that are intended to meet the need that I have. Sometimes it's based on a long track record of proven results (tret for acne). Other resources include recommendations from people who have similar skin type/needs, understanding what ingredients are likely to be beneficial or harmful to my skin in particular based on past experience, expert advice on specific products that are good for people with my needs (e.g. lists of good moisturizers for people on tret). But there's also some element of trial and error, which requires closely observing your skin to see how it reacts to new products and figuring out what you need to do different to better meet its needs.",15
긍정,"I research what most of the common ingredients are, what they’re supposed to do and what issues they target best and work from there. And then trial and error. I know it’s not that simple since I haven’t finished out my permanent routine either but this is how I approached it. I also enjoy watching videos about products and what people with my issues are doing but I know that’s not the most helpful per individual",16
중립,"Address one skin concern at a time, go from thinnest to thickest?",7
중립,"The Core: 
- One hydrator (humectant) to pull water into your skin 
- One moisturizer (emollient) that reinforces your skin barrier with skin-identical ingredients (cermaides + cholesterol + fatty acids) 
- One gentle cleanser 
- One SPF 

Above that: 
- One active that addresses my specific skin needs OR 
- Prescription actives if my skin requires them  

I work in a scientific/science - adjacent field, and really enjoy my peer-reviewed research papers lol. It’s fun bedtime reading. My actives are a retinoid and Azelaic Acid, both of which are indicated for my skin condition. This, in addition to the ‘core’ is all I need. Sure, I do enjoy experimentation with a new product once in a while, but I like a minimalistic system. I also travel for work a lot, so I can’t carry half a dozen things with me. Each product I choose has to play a specific role that is established through research, and I only need one of each. Beyond that, if I choose to add something, it’s only about preference.",7
중립,"AM: cleanse, AA, moisturizer, sunscreen. PM: Cleanse, Taz",4
중립,"I keep it simple with cleanse only if needed, vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreen in the morning, then cleanse, retinoid, and moisturizer at night; I choose products by sticking to well-studied actives like retinoids, vitamin C, niacinamide, and azelaic acid, patch testing and adding one change for 2 to 4 weeks while tracking my skin and skipping trends until results are consistent.",3

My current routine is AM: water rinse, toner, peptide serum, moisturizer, maybe sunscreen

PM: cleanser, toner, peptide serum or tretinoin, moisturizer",3
중립,"You answered your own question: Do what your skin needs. Only you know what your skin needs. You didn’t even say what your skincare goals are, so that makes it hard for people to offer input. It takes time and trial and error to scale down a routine that fits your needs. 

Also, lotion is not optional when you use retinoids. And it definitely isn’t when you use retinoids AND vitamin c daily. One thing about a “minimalist” routine is that it can actually be harmful to the barrier when you remove basic products. The scaling back needs to be thoughtful and reasonable. It isn’t just removing items; it’s also about knowing what to keep. Anything that supports your barrier and hydration should be in the routine. Whether you need niacinamide and Aza—only you know that.

I personally have a “base routine.” It is products that I use every single day, no matter what. From there, I bring in actives as I need them based on what I’m trying to achieve. It took me about three years to get the base routine down. So, I’d say be patient and intentional about the scaled-back routine, and be prepared for it take it a while to get it right.",3
긍정,"I would say bare minimum is a cleanser, moisturizer and spf. This is sufficient enough for am and pm routine if that all your skin needs.

If it needs more then:

1) figure out your skin type

2) what skin concern(s) are you trying to address

3) look into products that help that skin concern. Read online reviews, compare reviews on YouTube, reddit the official site etc. to gauge. If people had issues with the product see why, and what issues caused.

4) pop all the items you are interested in your cart, and asses them together as a whole routine or addition to your current routine and with your budget. The goal to to not have too many repetitive products, as too many products can also cause a negative effect. Also question whether this is smth you really need or are getting cause it's hyped up online and you've seen ""amazing"" effects. Chances are if your skin is already doing well you don't need to add anything.

5) let the thought marinate before buying

6) be consistent with using it once you get it, your not gonna see immediate results",3
중립,"I have adhd and low executive function so here’s my absolute bare minimum when I can’t keep up with life. my main focus is hydration. I use an oil cleanser and gel cleanser at the end of the day.

PM: reedle shot, toner, whatever sheet mask

PM: cosrx abc toner, melano cc premium essence (vitamin c), moisturiser - my skin is really sensitive so I’m gradually building resistance to eventually use stronger AHA/BHA and vitamin c.

긍정,"Through trial and error, I have a ""base"" that works for me. The base is face wash, hyaluronic acid serum, moisturizer, sunscreen. 

From there, I add actives based on what I want to focus on. For example, about three months ago I added azelaic acid in the morning because I've heard good things and I haven't tried it before, despite having redness. Because my base is solid, when I introduce a new product I can relatively quickly see if it works for me or not; azelaic acid did.

My main targets are acne and hyperpigmentation. My AM is gentle cleanser, vit C, lotion, sunscreen. PM is double cleanse, lotion, and alternate between tret/AHA/BHA. I also play things by ear a lot based on how my skin is doing that day. My goal has been to get to the point where I feel good going out without any concealer or coverup because I was just in this endless cycle of breaking out, concealing, breaking out even more, etc. And after half a year of my new routine I’ve really turned a corner.",2

PM - oil cleanser if I applied sunscreen that day, Isntree Milk cleanser, exfoliating clay mask 2 times a week, TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner, Medicube TXA/Niacinamide serum, Meditherapy Retinal Skin Booster (every other night), Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye serum, Medicube Salmon PDRN serum, Medicube Booster Pro (some days I will only use this in the AM so that I can apply VT Cosmetics Reedle Shot right after cleanser and before toner), either Medicube Collagen Jelly Cream if I did Booster Pro MC/derma shot mode that night, or TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Water cream if not, a hydrogel mask 3 times a week, and Medicube Ultra Tune after everything is fully absorbed.

중립,"I have 2 rules. 
- 1: my morning routine needs to be simple. If i use anything between a water cleanse (or rarely a micellar water) and my sinscreen, it needs to be frickin effective. In my case, it's mostly zinc PCA, bakuchiol and/or one of those stabile vitCs, cos i know those work. Maybe a random face mist to combat heat throughout the day.
- 2: no using actives on retinol night. So i don't use retinol every time, more like every other night, and the other fun things can go in between. (On that note: mists/toners can be fun. Essences and serums should be targeted and chosen for the active ingredient, at least in my routine.)",2
중립,"Long routines stress me out and I don't like feeling things on my skin/it being sticky. So in the morning I literally just cleanse (if I used active ingredients the night before) and suncream.

AM:

* water “cleanse” or mild cleanser
* gokujyun (Hada Labo)
* moisturizing serum (cosrx snail mucin)
* active serum and/or light moisturizer

PM:

* retinoid or peptide serum or reedle shot (I use retinoid every 2-3 days)
* heavier moisturizer",2
긍정,"How I determine what actives I’m choosing for a more streamlined routine has multiple factors:

A. Does this address more than one of *my* skin issues?

B. Have I used this active (or product) and found positive results? Or have I had better results in other actives or products?

C. Does it have long term benefits or been researched on? What does the medical literature suggest? Is it a fad?

My routine has both Asian skincare and American skincare so I won’t list out the exact products in my routine. I allotted one ‘additional’ product that wasn’t part of the core set that you listed (cleanse, moisturize, sun protection, retinoid). Has to be a good product that you’ve gotten amazing results with it, wouldn’t want to go without kind of thing.

My routine:
AM: no cleanse, just sunscreen before I do makeup
PM: double cleanse, toner (this is my chosen additional product), alternate Azelaic Acid and Retinoid, and moisturize!

My skin concerns are acne, redness (Rosacea), combo skin that’s prone to buildup of oils and dead skin but also gets dehydrated, also get PIE from pimples. So I wanted something that’s both soothing and hydrating with very mild exfoliation. 

If it helps at all, I discovered my hg toner because an app that analyzes your skin and helps make suggestions based on your skin type, preferences, with data of what you’ve tried before and liked/disliked. I don’t want to sound like an ad so I won’t mention the name unless someone asks me.",3
중립,"What you have listed is basically my routine. I make my routine by looking at what my skin needs, I don’t think about products first.

What kind of cleanser do I need? Hydrating cream cleanser for daily night use? Something with SA for post-workouts?

What skin issues am I really targeting? What kind of discoloration - brown vs red? Etc",1

긍정,Perfect answer.,2
중립,"I found the top-down approach to be easier for myself (otherwise I'd be way more lost and overwhelmed by all the available stuff on the market):

- Identify main skin concerns and know your skin type
- Rank in order of importance/largest impact 
- research clinically backed ingredients that address the top 1-2 concerns. Often, ingredients may have multiple benefits, and sometimes ingredients have different chemical forms, differing pros/cons (e.g. faster results but also increased risk of irritation), and sometimes have concentrations that are more effective vs more gentle. Pick one or two ingredients that address the top concern(s).
- Set a budget for how much you want to spend, then research the products that have your key ingredient at a clinically effective concentration. Narrow down to 3 max to consider.
- To decide between products, I compare online reviews (I find 3-4 star reviews to be more reliable), see if anyone on reddit with similar skin type and issues have shared their experience with the product, and see if any dermatologists online have reviewed the product. All sponsored reviews are taken with a large grain of salt, I generally don't trust/look for input from influencers either, but in this day and age we are all susceptible lol.
- Price and ease of purchase/receipt of product also is considered. I often add items to the cart and let it sit for at least a day, if not a week. That way I can be more confident it's not an impulse buy bc I was influenced into it.
- After receiving it, know that consistency is key when applying products. Also, introduce new products slowly (especially if the ingredients are known to be irritating), then increase the frequency I use it",11

So, I have been using my Apagard Premio from Amazon and I watched a video that mentioned that if I use Nano Hydroxypatite, after washing my teeth I should get a gritty feeling on my teeth from the Hydroxypatite crystalization, so I started to have doubts on my tooth paste as I never get a gritty sensation afterwards on my teeth, then I got from Google's ai that the paste itself should be soft and it shouldn't have a gritty, sandy texture like other toothpastes, can someone confirm if that's true? The one I bought has indeed a sandy texture when I bite into it, the box is very pretty but now I am unsure, help!
